Checklist</p>
<p>When a game master is working on creating a world, there are a lot of details to work out. Many a time I’ve thought I had a handle on a self-created milieu only to have a player ask for some information I’d not even thought to cover (it’s amazing what those pesky players can be interested in at times!). What I needed was a general checklist of things so that all my bases were covered, so to speak.</p>
<p>To that end, I’ve shamelessly stolen this idea. It used to be available on its own website, but it’s since gone offline. It looks like it might come up eventually again at <a href="http://www.btot.de/index-en.html" class="external">www.btot.de<svg aria-hidden="true" class="external-icon" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>, but as of this writing it’s not there yet. Luckily, I’d saved a copy. Of course, it’s been modified to my own needs, but you’re welcome to take it, leave it, or adjust it to your own needs as well.</p>
<p>It is, as ever, a work in progress. Here, at top, is a brief outline. Each topic links to some questions, below, to help refine the topic presented.</p>

<li>For what purposes are taxes (or new taxes) levied?</li>
<li>On what or on whom are taxes levied?</li>

<li>Are offices hereditary, elected, or appointed?</li>
<li>Can a government office be a career choice?</li>
<li>Is the relative power of a country or ruler usually measured by the size of the army, the number and ability of the wizards, or the amount of money and trade flowing through it?</li>
<li>Who will take over running the government if the current head-of-state is incapacitated?</li>
<li>How is succession determined?</li>

<li>How are the people with the power to give orders chosen?</li>
<li>Are any activities licensed or certified (driving, dog ownership, being an attorney or a physician)?</li>
<li>Who does the certification or licensing?</li>
<li>Is it merely formal (pay a fee, and get a license), or are there qualifications to meet?</li>
<li>Can licenses or certifications be revoked, and if so, how?</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>What are considered normal and legal ways of gathering evidence and determining guilt?</li>
<li>Are torture and magic part of the legal system?</li>
<li>Are arbitrary judgements by a lord or landowner allowed, or is there a standard that they are supposed to follow?</li>
<li>Is there an appeal system?</li>
<li>How high can a case go in the system before it is finally settled?</li>
<li>Is everyone tried in the same courts or are there special courts for special classes of people — for example, are mages tried in specialized wizard’s court?</li>
<li>Are there separate courts for civil and criminal matters?</li>
<li>Are there separate courts for magical and non-magical matters?</li>
<li>Are there separate courts for humans and non-humans?</li>
<li>Are there separate courts for religious matters?</li>
