**user**: This vault is a repository for worldbuilding of the Elderwood fantasy rpg setting.
It is incomplete.
Based on my notes give me a priority list of areas of worldbuilding that need fleshing out first.
[Timestamp: 2025/06/03 11:31:01]

**ai**: Based on the context provided, here's a prioritized list of worldbuilding aspects that need further development for the Elderwood setting:

1.  **Economy**: The [[Worldbuilding Checklist]] includes a detailed section on economy, with questions about goods produced, trade, economic systems, currency, and attitudes toward money and poverty. These questions need to be answered to establish the economic foundation of Elderwood.
2.  **Government**: Similar to economy, the [[Worldbuilding Checklist]] has a section on government. Given that the Elven Sovereignty is a major ruling faction, detailing the structure and nature of their government is crucial. Also, the form of government in [[The Human Reserve]] and other locations should be considered.
3.  **The Land**: Detailing the physical and historical features, climate, geography, and natural resources of Elderwood is important. This includes specifics about [[The Frozen North]], [[The Desiccated Isle]], Drakenmyre, and Xameer.
4.  **Society & Culture**: This is a broad category, but essential for bringing the world to life. The checklist covers various aspects like arts, entertainment, architecture, calendar, daily life, diet, education, ethics, fashion, history, language, manners, religion, and social organization.
5.  **Magic & Science**: Given the presence of [[Brass Elves]] and their magi-tech, it's important to define the rules of magic, the relationship between magic and technology, and how these elements affect medicine, science, transportation, and communication.

**user**: In which specific notes should these details be added or are new entires required?
[Timestamp: 2025/06/03 11:32:24]

**ai**: Based on the provided context, here's where you should add details for the prioritized worldbuilding aspects of the Elderwood setting:

*   **Economy**: This information should be added to a new note, as there is no specific note for economy in the current context. You can use the questions listed under "Economy" in the [[Worldbuilding Checklist]] note as a guide.
*   **Government**: This information should be added to a new note, as there is no specific note for government in the current context.
*   **The Land**: Details about the land can be expanded upon within the [[Section One Initial Overview]] note, specifically when describing the various regions like The Elven Sovereignty, [[The Human Reserve]], The Frozen North, The Desiccated Isle, Drakenmyre, and Xameer. You can also create separate notes for each of these locations and link them to the [[Section One Initial Overview]] note.
*   **Society & Culture**: This information should be added to a new note, as there is no specific note for society and culture in the current context.
*   **Magic & Science**: This information should be added to a new note, as there is no specific note for magic and science in the current context. You can also expand on the [[Brass Elves]] and Fabricants within their respective notes, linking them to the broader Magic & Science aspects of Elderwood.
