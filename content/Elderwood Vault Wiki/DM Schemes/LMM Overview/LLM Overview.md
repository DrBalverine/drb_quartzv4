[[THE LIST]]

I wish to use a LMM to create adventures for a custom pre-made fantasy setting, following a previous conversation with you the best way to give you the context and worldbuilding required to make an adventure tailored to the setting would be to give you information on the setting under the following headings.

1. Initial Overview: Begin by giving the LMM a high-level overview of your fantasy setting. Describe the key features, such as the world's name, major locations, prominent races, and any unique aspects of the world. Include information about the setting's history, magic system (if applicable), and overall tone.

2. Geography and Locations: Provide details about the various regions, cities, towns, and landmarks within your setting. Describe their distinctive characteristics, cultures, and inhabitants. Mention any noteworthy geographical features like mountains, rivers, forests, or deserts.

3. Major Factions and Societies: Introduce the major factions, kingdoms, guilds, or societies present in your setting. Provide information about their ideologies, motivations, relationships with each other, and any ongoing conflicts or power struggles.

4. Races and Creatures: Detail the different races or species inhabiting your world. Explain their physical attributes, cultural traits, and relationships with other races. If there are any unique creatures or monsters, describe their characteristics, behaviors, and habitats.

5. Magic System: If your fantasy setting has a magic system, describe its rules, limitations, and types of magic available. Include information about how magic is learned, its source (if applicable), and any specific spells or abilities associated with it.

6. History and Lore: Share significant historical events that have shaped your world. Explain the origins of important artifacts, legendary figures, or mythical creatures. Provide any relevant information about prophecies, ancient civilizations, or forgotten ruins.

7. Current Events and Conflicts: Discuss ongoing conflicts, political tensions, or looming threats in your setting. Provide details about recent developments, important figures, and the potential consequences of these conflicts. This information will help the LMM incorporate current events into the adventure.

8. Player Goals and Objectives: Clearly communicate the goals and objectives you want the LLM to focus on when generating adventures. Specify if there are any particular quests, challenges, or storylines you would like to include. You can also mention any moral dilemmas or choices you want the players to face.

9. Villains and Plots: Providing an overview of the villains and their objectives in your custom pre-made fantasy setting would be extremely useful. Understanding the motivations, characteristics, and goals of the antagonists allows the LLM to generate adventures and storylines that revolve around conflicts with these villains. Do you concur?
