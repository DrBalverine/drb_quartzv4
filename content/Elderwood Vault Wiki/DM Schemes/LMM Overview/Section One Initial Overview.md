[[THE LIST]]


1. Initial Overview:

I will use the Genesys RPG system.

The world is called Elderwood. It is named after the vast forests covering most of the land. Elves are the most prominent race and they rule over the other races.

Most other standard D&D fantasy races are also present as well as [[Brass Elves]] a magi-tech adept species who created Fabricants (this settings version of warforged). The major locations are The Elven Sovereignty ( the area ruled over by the elven ruling faction of the same name), [[The Human Reserve]] ( a vassal area that was given by the Elven Sovereignty to Humans and other races to govern themselves in), The Frozen North ( a vast area of icey tundra that was devastated by a great magical calamity, the area is now the territory of very dangerous demons), The Desiccated Isle ( a desert country with a society of undead with ancient Egyptian stylings) , Drakenmyre ( an area of haunted swamps and gothic castles, ruled by vampires) , Xameer ( an unexplored continent that hides a dragonborn empire).
