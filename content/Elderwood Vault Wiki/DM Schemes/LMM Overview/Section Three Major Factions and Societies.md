[[THE LIST]]
1. Major Factions and Societies:

Major Factions and Societies: Introduce the major factions, kingdoms, guilds, or societies present in your setting. Provide information about their ideologies, motivations, relationships with each other, and any ongoing conflicts or power struggles.

- [[The Elven Sovereignty]]: The ruling noble faction of Elderwood. They rule over the other nations but after the ruin of the north their territory is no longer bigger than their vassals. [[The Elven Sovereignty]] is made up of solely High elves, called such only to distinguish themselves against their Wyld Elf cousins.  
    [[The Elven sovereignty]] began when the elves overthrew the tyrannical Eladrin Empire. They have picked up some of their former oppressors traits and [[the elven sovereignty]] of today has a reputation for being oppressive, corrupt, proud, arrogant and snobbish.  They wish to maintain their power by whatever means and not show weakness to the other races.

- The Bureau: The intelligence and security service for [[The Elven Sovereignty]]. They are highly skilled agents, tasked with secret missions to serve the interest of [[The Elven Sovereignty]] or at least the nobles with enough influence.

They do the underhanded secret dirty work that keeps [[the Elven Sovereignty]] in power.

- [[Brass Elves]]: Magi-tech adept isolationist elves, they hide in great underground citadels where in they create fantastical works of artifice in their vast workshops. They are the creators of the Fabricants (beings similar to warforged) They are vassals under [[The Elven Sovereignty]] but care more for their craft than politics. They originally went into isolation as they predicted a great calamity and protected themselves from it by locking their civilisation in vast underground citadels. Now one such citadel has reopened and they search for the other citadels which are now lost.

- Wyld Elves: Druidic cousins to [[the elven sovereignty]]. They rejected the more metropolitan life that the Sovreignty became and focus on maintaining harmony with natural forces. They are nomadic and travel the vast forests of elderwood protecting their ancestor glades (areas of particular druidic importance). They have secret knowledge of how the natural planes function that have otherwise been lost to time. [[The Elven Sovereignty]] want to reintegrate them into their dominion but the wyld elves do not want this. Also the wyld elves clash with humanity often over use of natural resources.

- Lich Lords: The previous overlords of [[the elven sovereignty]] vassal state given over for [[human]] habitation. These powerful necromancers ruled over the [[human]] population with dark forbidden magic and tyrannical oppression. They did not care for their people outside of their usefulness to their magical experiments. They were overthrown by The Silver Knight Rebellion, where a group of paladins rose up and defeated their regime. Now small necromancy cults wish to resurrect them to gain their dark powers.

- Humans ([[Kingdoms of Korelilon]])  
    The ruling government of [[The Human Reserve]], a vassal kingdom of The Elven Sovreignty to make a place for [[Human|humans]] to live apart form elves. It was established after the fall of the Lich Lords. There is currently no ruling family so a council of the nobles from each area make kingdom spanning decisions. This is split into the following fiefdoms:

[[Duchy of Cordagh]]: The most honourable of the fiefdoms. Was previously the seat of the kingdom but no longer. They try to cling onto the noble ideals of the old kingdom but struggle under elven sovereignty rulership.  
  
[[Duchy of Korag]]: A dark and swampy area, the current main city of this area is built on the ruins of an old Lich Lords settlement. It is now a pit of crime and corruption. The ruler of this area Master Doud is a fat corrupt man who uses his position to further his wealth at the expense of his people, using criminal organisations to keep his power.

  
Duchy of [[Visas]]: Ruled by the enigmatic [[Lady Visas]], this area is a strange and gothic. It's capital the city called [[Visas]] is also the home of [[The Crystal college]] and a large [[Synod]] presence. [[Visas]] have few greater political goals as Lady Visas is often silent of most issues. Personal freedom and ambition are encouraged.  
  
[[Crossroads]] County: Placed at the intersection of 2 great trade routes through the forest of ancestors Crossroads is a peaceful and prosperous district. They are accepting of all peoples as they pass through and support the needs of the races other than [[human]] and elf strongly.  
  
 

- [[The Synod]] of [[The Radiant Accord]]

The primary religious authority in Elderwood with shrines in most towns and villages. Their main seat is in the Duchy of Cordagh

- Wizards of [[The Crystal College]]
Master of magic and the mystic arts, the wizards of the crystal college are consummate academics. The college is named after the memory crystals apon which the wizards pour their knowledge into. They are more focused on the discovery of knowledge than morality but they are also the first and last line of defence against threats to the world from outside the material plane and consider it a duty of care, they are obliged to aid people with magical problems.


- [[The Troupe of Fools]]

Jesters, bards, actors and all sort of performers. In their position they have the power to influence popular opinion and culture to sway the political

- Demons of the North

The Northern wastes was at one point a vast area making up over half of the elven sovereigntys territory. Due to a magical cataclysm a rip in the planes was created between here on the material plane and the hells. This allowed demon hordes to pour through and invade. This was only quelled by the creation of the Spirit Fence, a vast continent spanning structure that repels them and keeps them contained. The demons agenda is to punish, corrupt and conquer.

The gothic vampire kingdom.

The underground resistance against the Drakenmyre Vampyrium
