[[THE LIST]]
1. Geography and Locations:

The major Areas are; [[The Elven Sovereignty]], [[The Human Reserve]], The Northern Wastes, The Desiccated Isle, Drakenmyre and Xameer.

Each of these countries has several notable locations within, here is an overview of them.

[[The Elven Sovereignty]]:

- Aurora-Sylvadis, the capital of The Elven Sovreignty and by extension all Elderwood. An ancient Elven city built on the remains of the capital of a long gone Eladrin Empire.
- Groaroths Fall  
    A settlement built around a waterfall and the remains of a dead Titan. This area is currently inhabited by Orc refugees who have fled the demons in The Frozen North.
- Sulchin Ger, The primary settlement of the Taurus (a minotaur-like species) it is surrounded by great plains.
- The House of Aljana, another Elven town similar to Rivendell.
- Port Tijara, the largest port city in Elderwood and a hub for trade and commerce.

The Human Reserve:

- Cordagh Citadel, a mighty fortress capital of [[the Human Reserve]]. The great citadel similar to Minas Tirith. It sits outside of the Forest of Ancestors which covers most of Elderwood and is surrounded by farmland.
- [[Visas]], Seat of knowledge and religion for Elderwood. This dark broody city is split into many districts the most notable being, The Crystal College: The foremost institute of wizardry, [[The Synod]]: The great cathedral district, The Grim: a haunted area cursed by a magical accident, The Palace District: Where nobles and Lady Visas the city's enigmatic ruler live, The Warrens: a great underbelly of the city made up of numerous uncharted tunnels.
- Gravesford, A major settlement of the Lich Lords who used to rule [[the Human Reserve]] until a rebellion vanquished them. It sits on a river and was a place of major industry for them.
- Roc Fell, a tall mountainous region that houses the citadel of the hawklords (an aarakokra-like species), agents of the god of justice train here.
- Briarspring, a small village that sits on top of an evil temple. A priest of the nature god planted magical roses around the town's water supply that wards off the evil from below. The players have defeated the priestess of this temple and everything is fine now. The temple also houses a locked door to the underdark.
- -Crossroads, sitting in the middle of many trade routes and at a good rest stop for a journey through the forest of ancestors Crossroads is a prosperous town where most will pass through at some time when journeying around elderwood.
- Kher Muldur, the surface side fortress of the dwarves where they trade with other peoples. Kher Muldur has extensive mines and long underground canals which allow shipments of goods almost anywhere in elderwood.
- Korag Fens, a large swamp and marshland with a few settlements such as the town called Korag, Bogwood and the ruined Doud. The primary industries of this area revolve around peat and crime.
- Shar Mzark, the hub of [[Brass Elves|Brass Elf]] civilisation where magical and technological wonders can be found. The [[Brass elves]] are slightly isolationist and use fabricants (similar to warforged) for most mundane tasks. This is one of many [[Brass Elves|Brass Elf]] colonies but most are lost and forgotten. There is a city built around where Shar Mzark meets the surface overground called [[Cogdoor]].

The Frozen North:

- The Great Gate, a powerful defensive fortress that acts as the only enterance through The Spirit Fence. The Spirit Fence is a vast magical structure than cuts across the entire land splitting the Elven Sovreignty off from The Frozen North (Sometimes called The Northern Wastes). This barrier is powered by souls of ancestors and repels the demon hordes that hunt In the Frozen North.
- The Grey Keep, The last great bastion of Goliath kind. So few Goliath are left after the ruin of the north that they congregate at The Grey keep hoping to do great things and be remembered before their species dies out.
- The Ice Ringed Chaos, a jagged mountain range centred on a vast volcano. This volcano is magical in nature and is a literal wound in the world from which demons can crawl out. This concentration of energy saps warmth from the region making The Frozen North into the ice blasted wasteland it is today.
- The area of The Frozen North also has many other points of interest. Many of these are ruined or abandoned structures from before the ruin of the north occurred (The Ruin of The North is the name for the event which created the ice ringed chaos) examples are; ancient wizard towers, fortress ruins now inhabited by demons, evacuated towns left abandoned etc etc.

The Desiccated Isle: This island is separated from Elderwood mainland by a stretch of ocean called The Salt Aegis.

- Kult Hadarra, the seat of power and capital of The Dessicated Isle. This vast city surround the lake of blood which spews from the ziggurat at the center ofÂ  a vast lake. Inside this ancient ziggurat resides The Vermillion Shround, most ancient and powerful of all the vampires of The Dessicated Isle. The rivers that flow from this Ziggurat are called The Great Vein and they split the isle into four quadrants. The Sinking Fields, The Nihiyat Dunes, The Damar Plains and The Sapphire Rift.
- Other notable location on The Dessicated Isle are The Sorched Bastille, a perilous prison and Canid Cove a shelter for Kobold Pirates.

Drakenmyre: Drakenmyre has yet to be fully fleshed out but I have some notes of a few locations. Overall it should have a very gothic theme, large swamp areas and pine forests.

- Jagentear Dell, a werewolf settlement inspired by the Cossacks and Tatars.
- Port Gespenstein, a haunted port which houses a cathedral to the undead that keeps the towns population eternally in spirit form. They harvest ectoplasm for rituals.
- Fuergard Gruft, an afflicated town with vast catacombs and a problem with wraiths. The ruined Flamtaer ( a temple dedicated to funeral pyres) could be the solution.
- Mouldenberg, a [[human]] settlement under the rule of the Drakenmyre overlords. They keep the people in line by demanding tithes of blood. This town hides a secret resistance to The Drakenmyre rulers. It also houses a grove of bloodwood trees. The bloodwood tree is an ancestor tree that grows only in places of prominent bloodshed and violence.
- Mengelhaven and Schloss Sanguinesti, Mengelhaven is the capital of Drakenmyre and is a large dark brooding city reminiscent of a dark gothic 17th century era london. At it's height is Schloss Sanguinesti the palace and noble district of the city where the noble vampires of The Drakenmyre Vampyrium reside.
- Sepherinheim, a holdout of holy priests and paladins that was utterly decimated by the vampires from Schloss Sanguinesti. There may well still be artifacts hidden here that could help against the dark creatures of Drakenmyre.

Xameer:

- Xameer is mostly uncharted but consists of very dangerous jungle. Hidden in the jungle is an empire of dragonborn ruled by ancient dragons. Their society has a aztec theme to it.

Other Planes:  
Outside of the Material Plane which all the above are part of, there are a number of other planes of existence. These include;

The Elemental Planes (Air, Earth, Fire, Water)

These elemental planes embody the element they represent and are responsible for that elements influence on the material plane. Each has unique inhabitants that work to keep the elements in balance.  
The Air Plane: Populated by Lepidoptra, anthropomorphic moth people. The air plane is endless skies and flying palaces of marble. The Lepidoptra are kind and take their duty seriously, revering The Great Balance, their concept of the duty to keep the elemental forces in balance between the planes.

The Astral Sea:
