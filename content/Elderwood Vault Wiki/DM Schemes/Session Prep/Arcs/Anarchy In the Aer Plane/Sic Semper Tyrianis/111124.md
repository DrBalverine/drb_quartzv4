Psurlon and Tyria Escape convosation
The ritual interrupted

T "It may not be too late"

P "But it is, much too late, the damage has been done. The incursion is thwarted, the celestial released, the anchor destroyed. This operation has failed."

T "Not yet, the situation can be managed, the damage controlled"

P "The disconnected must not gain access to our powers or secrets. We commence exit stratagems"

T "Please.....That would be ..... inefficient. I am uplifted, I have given my being for The Aboleth, I can serve further"

P "THERE CAN BE NO DISSENT, Focus on me little mothling, flicker of a mind....under my control"

T "We.....must......flee"

P "Not you, that body is known and compromised with feeling it will be destroyed along with any evidence of our being here"

PSURLON CASTS A SPELL
The city begins to fall

"Will you not stay little mortals. Our destruction means nothing, we can build other bodies. Join the Aboleth, fulfil the deepest desire of all your kind. Immortality free of the burden of choice"

Join us, reject the usurpers of creation the so called Numina Gods and become supplicants to the aboleth, whos wisdom remembers before the dawn.
