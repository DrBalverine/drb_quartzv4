# The Quiet of Bones
*A 5-room gothic dungeon of ghosts, bloodlines, and bitter legacies beneath the Marrowmore Manor.*

---

## ❖ Summary

The **Marrowmore crypt** lies beneath the estate. The body of **Baron Edran Marrowmore** cannot be interred—**a ghost haunts the crypt**, violently repelling all who enter.

His heir, **Stretis Marrowmore**, hires the party to “deal with the ghost” and retrieve the **Baron’s seal** from the family vault.

But the ghost is **Merril**, the Baron's secret lover and mother of both **Stretis** and the maid **Varli**. Stretis poisoned the Baron after discovering he meant to name Varli the heir—and stabbed Merril when she found the new will. Merril fled to the crypt and died there, hiding the evidence.

The party’s true task: **uncover the truth** of Merril’s murder, lay her spirit to rest, and decide the future of House Marrowmore.

---

## ❖ Key NPCs

- **Baron Edran Marrowmore** – Deceased. Regretted raising Stretis. Planned to pass title to Varli.
- **Stretis Marrowmore** – Current heir. Cold, calculating. Bastard son of the Baron and Merril.
- **Varli** – Loyal maid. Secretly the Baron's daughter. Grew up beside Stretis, unaware they are twins.
- **Merril** – Former head maid. Secret partner of the Baron. Ghost now haunts the crypt. Mortally wounded by Stretis while protecting the will.

---

## ❖ Adventure Hook

Stretis summons the party:

> “The crypt has become... hostile. Priests flee. The ghost does not want me near. I need someone to retrieve the **Baron’s seal** from the vault. The estate can’t function without it.”

**Insight DC 13:** He is hiding something. Afraid, not grieving.

### Room 1: The Wine Stair *(Entrance)*

**Description:** A hidden stair behind the wine rack leads to the crypt’s arched threshold. Air stale. Stones cold.

**Encounter:**  
- Animated **skeletal vines** choke the stair. DC 14 Dex save or restrained. Burn with radiant or fire damage.

**Clues:**
- **Merril’s locket** (fallen nearby): shows two children—one with Stretis’s distinctive birthmark.
- A wax-sealed sarcophagus labeled **Edran Marrowmore**—empty.

---

### Room 2: The Bone Wall *(Guardian)*

**Description:** A towering wall of skulls and femurs, with a sentinel carved of bone.

**Trap/Puzzle:**  
- **Bone Sentinel** animates unless bypassed with a **blood-smeared handstone** and whispering Merril’s name.

**Finds:**
- **Merril’s shallow grave**, bloody dress.
- The **unsigned will** naming Varli heir.
- A trail of blood leading deeper into the crypt.

---

### Room 3: Baron’s Shrine *(Puzzle Room)*

**Description:** A partially desecrated altar to the family dead.

**Puzzle:**
- Reconstruct a **burned letter** from the Baron (fragments around the shrine):

> “Varli is the better choice. Stretis... he is not his mother, but she lives in him. Merril will know what to do.”

**Optional Trap – The Baroness’s Kiss:**
- Pressure plate triggers poisoned needle (DC 14 Dex or 3d6 poison damage, DC 15 Con).
- Gargoyle’s tongue is a hidden **key lever** to unlock a **burned journal**:
  - Confirms Baroness was an assassin.
  - Confirms Stretis is a bastard.

---

### Room 4: The Memory Chamber *(Climax)*

**Description:** Blue glow. Merril’s ghost reenacts her final moments in silence.

**Spectacle:**
- Vision of her mortally wounded, hiding the will and seal, whispering last regrets.

**Ghost Dialogue:**
- “He put poison in the wine.”
- “I hid the will... I ran... he didn’t follow.”
- “Tell her. Let her know.”
- “I don’t want revenge. I want rest.”

---

### Room 5: Vault of Silence *(Resolution)*

**Locked behind a riddle door – The Mourner’s Gate**

**Riddle Inscription:**

> “I have no breath, and yet I speak.  
> I hold no pen, and yet I write.  
> I am born of silence, and carry the dead.  
> What am I?”

I am last words and conviction. I am spine and I am power. I am ...


**Answer:** `A will`  
- Incorrect: 1d4 psychic damage and whisper: _“Not yet. Listen closer.”_

**Inside the Vault:**
- **The Baron’s seal** (wolf swallowing a lily).
- **Merril’s letter** (see below).
- **Mourning ring** (one question may be asked of Merril’s ghost; she answers plainly).
- **Baroness’s mirror** (reveals true parentage of one character, once).
- **Lockbox** of heirlooms, documents, and secrets.

---

## ❖ Merril’s Letter

> _To whomever finds this—_  
> I write with what strength remains. My hand shakes. The wound is deep. I will not see the sun again.  
>
> Stretis has killed his father. Poison in the wine. I found the new will—saw what the Baron intended. He wished Varli, our daughter, to inherit.  
>
> Stretis came for the will. I told him nothing. He saw it gone, and struck. I ran.  
>
> The crypt is cold. Familiar. I kept the keys. I remembered the guardian’s verse. I’ve hidden the seal and the will beyond it.  
>
> The Baron’s place remains empty. He must wait until truth lies beside him.  
>
> Varli must know. She is more than a maid. She is the Baron’s child. She is my daughter. She is worthy.  
>
> _Merril_

---

## ❖ Resolutions

- **Give seal to Stretis:** He forges false documents. Merril’s ghost remains. Varli stays a maid.
- **Give seal and will to Varli:** She becomes heir. Stretis is exposed or flees.
- **Destroy the seal and documents:** Truth buried. Merril unsettled. The haunting may never end.
- **Keep the seal, bargain with both:** Intrigue, blackmail, dangerous games.

---

## ❖ Optional Epilogue

After Merril is laid to rest:
- The sarcophagus in Room 1 opens of its own accord.
- A breeze of roses and dust. The Baron may now be buried.
- Varli may speak a few final words over the tomb.
- Stretis, if alive, watches from the doorway—expression unreadable.

- **Baron Edran Marrowmore** – Deceased. Regretted raising Stretis. Planned to pass title to Varli.
    
- **Stretis Marrowmore** – Current heir. Cold, calculating. Bastard son of the Baron and Merril. Claims to have arrived after the deaths, but this is a lie. He came the night before and was only seen by Merril and the Baron.

- **Mother Grielle** – Visiting priestess who attempted to exorcise the ghost and failed. Deeply disturbed. Claims the spirit only calms when Varli is near.

## ❖ Adventure Hook

Stretis summons the party:

> "The crypt has become... hostile. Priests flee. The ghost does not want me near. I need someone to retrieve the **Baron’s seal** from the vault. The estate can’t function without it."

**Insight DC 13:** He is hiding something. Afraid, not grieving.

**Additional Note:** Due to the haunting, the Baron’s body remains unburied, sealed in a temporary coffin in the upper chapel.

---

## ❖ Setup & Introduction

### Arrival:

The players arrive at **Marrowmore Manor**, a towering gothic estate veiled in fog. Thunder threatens rain. They are greeted first by **Elias Quent**, the steward, who shows them to a formal sitting room.

### Character Introduction Order:

1. **Elias Quent** – Dry, efficient, evasive when questioned about the murders. "A tragedy. Terrible timing."
    
2. **Stretis Marrowmore** – Arrives shortly after, grim and polite. Offers the job. Avoids discussing his arrival timeline unless pressed.
    
3. **Varli** – The players may meet her while exploring the house. She is quiet, wearing mourning black, but warms if shown kindness. Clearly grieving.
    
4. **Mother Grielle** – Found praying in the chapel. She appears shaken and may blurt fragments of her failed exorcism.
    
5. **Old Darrik** – Lurking near the crypt entrance. Nervous and muttering about the dead not staying put.
    

This order builds a sense of intrigue and suspicion, setting up key relationships before the players descend into the crypt.
