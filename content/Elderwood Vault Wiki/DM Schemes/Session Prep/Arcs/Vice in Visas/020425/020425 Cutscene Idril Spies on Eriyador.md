Opening Cutscene
Idril spies on Eriyador

It is time to get a few more answers.
Eriyador is in Visas and where they are Calvus will likely be lurking in the shadows. Time to put father's training to good use.
Whilst rummaging through Grasks old smuggling post Idril uncovers a small but sturdy rowboat, little more than a canoe but it will do.
The beggars of a city always make the best informants, they see all and aren't seen. A few hot meals bought here and there and now you know where she'll be and when. 
Under cover of night you slip the mooring, Jam stands forlornly watching as you get smaller and smaller fading into the midnight mists over the river.
You can barely see infront of you but in reverse that means you can barely be seen. The river is choked with fog but the sky is crystal clear as if the clouds had landed to rest. 
You try not to stare at the glittering starlight too much, it makes your eye ache.

You arrive, hide the canoe in the reeds and slip onto the estate. The guards are alert enough but no true match, you have greatly stacked the odds against them this time.
The bright moonlight bathes the immaculate garden in silver, turning a no doubt beautiful floral display utterly monochrome. You make it to a flintwork gardeners shed and slip inside, the roof has many large gaps and on one wall a window looks towards your target. You saw their carriage arrive just as you had,  now Lady Elana Eriyador enters the lounge, unaware of the spy with a clear view inside.

Nocking the Far Ear Flights you take aim up through the holes in the roof. These things had better be worth it Muggers don't mug themselves and these were expensive. With a little sigh you remember your Bureau days when costs had no meaning, nothing is valued higher than the security of realm. You loose the arrow and it arcs silently up and over then down into the chimney of the low crackling fire of Eriyador's lounge. You won't have much time before it burns up but now you have an ear in the room, Holding your bow out you listen to the string resonate, replicating the sounds in the room.

Elana speaks to her bodyguard Captain Corsith in haughty elven tones.
"MAHN FAHS en GWING-weg MIE-thor, PEN-seg ah EH-khwin-ar,      hahahahhaha  OO-FEYL-leer  "
Elana - What a load of whingeing peasants, they think that they are noble, that they can win and become civilised. hahhahahahahha They can't.

Corsith - Forgive me my lady but why do we then waste our time on them.

Elana - Because when our Malcis gains the glory and status they crave, we will have this wretched place on a leesh. Working through them makes our actions in these lands legal, For as long as Malcis doesnt break their vows to Lady Visas we are free to undermine this city.

Corsith - What of the necromancer? I do not see how ---

Corsith's query is cut of with the sound of flexing and cracking wood as a wooden bust on a table turns to look at Elana as a face begins to carve itself onto the wood.

Malrissa - Yes QUITE, I do not approve of your choice of allies daughter of mine. This Calvus is a rot at the foundations,

At that voice Elana and Corsith kneel immediately and bow low to the floor before their matriarch. Malrissa Eriyador, ancient elven noble, member of sovereignty court and council , spymaster head of the sovereignty security bureau.

Elana - "they have been of great help mother, even undirected their work destabilises the region, they are a sublte poison that will weaken this land for one day when it will return to us."

Malrissa - "Do you wish to rule or not? Then hear me girl and listen well, the sovereignty hangs by a thread.
There are enemies on all sides and more from within. Foul demons from the north, betrayers beneath, sand sorcerers to the east and blood nightmares to the south. Not only that but smoke rises from Xameer.
Amidst all this the high court to our Domina argues ceaselessly, unable to take firm action and ambassadors from unknown lands whisper and plot.

For this gambit of yours to succeed chaos is not enough, we cannot afford the soldiers that conquest would require, the people must be utterly broken, tyranny galvanises their will, bolsters hope, we have seen this with the fall of the clergy of rot and the silver knights. A Tyrant they will rebel against But a saviour they will love.

Bolster this Count Malcis of yours, make them a light in the darkness of your own design then finally we can once more bring the land back under our protection and have peace.
But hear this girl and mark it well; quell this demon threat, you cannot begin to understand the sacrifice made to hold them back. Demons are not to be trifled with, insidious beyond your understanding and cannot ever be controlled. Do not mistake their beastial forms, if you are under any illusions that you are in control then they have outwitted you and you do not even realise. Find your necromancer, bring them to heel, you will have Bureau support. Grim things scuttle in the undercity, I would start there. DO NOT fail me girl.

Elana - y-y-yes mother. 

Malrissa - And Corsith, be watchful, I can see that eavesdropper arrow from here, find them and remove them.
 
 Corsith wheels around and stares out of the window
 
SHIT SHIT FUCK RUN RUN RUN
