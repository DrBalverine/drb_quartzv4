**Meanwhile,

Coronet Parade, House Malcis Stables 

_A fabricant steed stands motionless on a circular dais. Its bronze musculature gleams, eyes flickering with an uncertain blue. A complex blend of braided metal forms the facsimile of sinew, it's mechanical spine along centepede of electrum down it's back. Though adorned with fine engravings, It was built for battle. It was built to serve. Yet brand new from the forge's womb has not yet galloped._

Enter **Lady Eriyador**, long-limbed, narrow-faced, and dressed like a wineglass made flesh. She gestures with a silver-tipped fan, though the air is still and her disdain palpable.

Trailing her is **Clinterik**, a brass-elf with a monocular surgically affixed into one socket and a permanent frown etched into his oxidised features. His tools, other small fabricants wait beside him, buzzing softly.

**Lady Eriyador (dry, melodic):**  
It hasn't even been ridden yet. Delightfully wasteful.

**Clinterik (adjusting his gloves):**  
Fully integrated. Living alloy. Adaptive balance algorithms. Extremely advanced. Possibly sentient.

**Lady Eriyador:**  
Yes, how unfortunate. Make sure it forgets all that before you take it apart.

_She walks a slow circle around the steed, examining it like a bored duchess inspecting fruit. The fabricant’s gaze follows her, silently pleading. She ignores it. Her gaze turns to Count Malcis' Corvax, a bipedal gryphon like creature used for High tower jousting in Visas_

**Lady Eriyador:**  
Baron Malcis must not merely fly. He must _descend_. Like a righteous comet. An angel with talons. I want that saddle socket grafted into the corvax’s sternum, and the shock-absorption nerves laced into its wing joints.

**Clinterik:**  
That will involve—  
_He hesitates, glancing at the horse, then back to her._  
—that will involve removing its heart, it's .....core.

**Lady Eriyador (snaps her fan closed):**  
Then remove it. And save it for me. I want it turned into a brooch. Something tasteful. Something that says: _Yes, I did this, and no, I don’t regret it._

Just a little reminder for Rustwing next time we meet. That I am in charge.

_She smiles, barely. The fabricant makes a small noise—like a hinge trying to pray._

**Clinterik (murmuring):**  
It was designed to dream of open fields.

**Lady Eriyador (turns to leave):**  
So was I. But I settled for conquering them.

_She exits. Clinterik lingers. Tools descend like vultures as the dais lights up crimson._

**[Cut to black.]**  
_The sound of metal screaming._

With nothing they can do, Idril slips from their hiding spot and goes to find the group.

Meanwhile our heroes are relaxing in their hot tub as Madame Gorr, potential trainer to our would be knight evaluates her student.
