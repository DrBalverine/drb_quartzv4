**Scene: The Laboratory of Glass and Iron**

The workshop reeks of scorched copper and sour rot. The smell clings to the throat, acrid and metallic, undercut by the rank sweetness of decay. The air is damp and heavy; each breath carries the tang of iron and the faint bitterness of alkalis. Thin green vapor seeps from the seams of brass pipes, hissing softly, whispering in the gloom.

Racks of jars line the soot-streaked walls. The glass is milky from years of handling, and the fluid inside is the color of old  tea and reeks of vinegar. Shapes float within the mirk—specimens twisted and abhorrent.

Dr. Caustis, hunched and gaunt, stoops over a workbench. He adjusts the flame beneath a syrup-thick potion. The surface of the mixture trembles, swelling in slow, viscous pulses as if something within were breathing.

With a pair of long iron tongs he plucks a bloated white maggot from a shallow dish of sour mash. The maggot twists and writhes, its translucent skin so stretched you can see its pulsing gut within. Caustis dips the creature into the heated potion. It thrashes violently, its soft flesh blanching, then taking on a faint phosphorescent glow as it drinks in the liquid.

He raises it carefully and carries it to a bell jar that sits atop a stained oak table. Inside, a soot-grey rat crouches low, its fur patchy and damp, it’s eyes glowing faintly. Each wheezing breath spills a faint ribbon of noxious green fume that coils upward before dissipating.

Caustis croons almost tenderly:

“A better breath, my child. Let us gift you a moment of purity.”

With a careful hand he unlatches the jar. A fetid breath of noxious air escapes as he drops the maggot within. It lands upon the rat’s spine with a wet _plip_ and immediately begins to writhe forward. Its hooked mouthparts pierce the animal’s hide; it pushes inward, forcing itself between the creature’s shoulder blades. The rat thrashes, claws scraping helplessly against the glass, while the maggot burrows deeper, leaving behind a glossy trail of greenish slime that bubbles faintly on contact with the straw.

For a moment the rat stills. Its ragged coughs cease. It lifts its narrow head, nostrils quivering, and draws in a long, clean breath. Its eyes, usually dull and red-rimmed, widen—clear and almost bright with clarity and cunning.

Then the change begins. Its sides heave in violent spasms; ribs crack audibly like brittle reeds beneath a boot. Pale splinters of bone lance through its thinning skin, stretching the flesh until it splits. Black veins crawl across its snout in frantic, branching lines, and its tail coils tight as wire, snapping with a dry _pop_. The high, keening squeal that follows rises to a shriek before the throat tears open in a wet rip. A spray of frothy, pale blood spatters the inside of the glass, hissing and smoking where it lands.

The rat collapses, half-burst, twitching once before becoming still. A soft steam rises from its open ribcage, carrying a coppery, acrid tang.

Dr. Caustis does not flinch. But calmly makes notes as he kicks the tiny creatures corpse to join the mound beneath the bench. Former test subjects, a grotesque midden of progress: tiny skeletons curled like withered roots, things with half-formed limbs or too many jaws, some with slick, eyeless heads that still twitch faintly at the edge of death. The stench that rises from the heap is thick—rotting meat mingled with chemical sourness—and it seeps into every corner of the lab.

Caustis replaces his pen, then steady and unhurried he plucks another swollen maggot. He cradles it gently, like a jeweler weighing a precious stone, and murmurs:

“A step closer. Progress does not come cheap.”

The next rat thrashes wildly in its wire cage as he approaches, its claws rasping against the bars. The green potion in the vial bubbles once more, slow and deliberate, as though keeping time with a heartbeat.
