The tavern door slams open, rattling mugs on the shelves. A figure stumbles inside, feathers heavy with rain, breath misting in frantic bursts. It’s **Moonwing**, in a uncharacteristic panic, eyes wide with dread.

“TORIN!” he blurts, striding to the counter, scattering a few startled patrons. His hands grip the wood so tight something threatens to crack. “Have you seen the kids—have they been through here? Tell me they’ve not gone to the flood yet!”

Torin blinks, wiping her hands on a rag, the easy calm in her manner paling under Moonwing's urgency. “They were here about two hours ago. Left in good spirits, off to see that old hermit historian you recommended.”

Moonwing's face drains of colour. He slams a sodden scroll on the bar, the wax seal broken, words inked in a script that seems to shift when glanced at.

“He is no hermit,” Moonwing shouts, voice breaking. “He's a chained monster. Gods help them—he is _Lord Zharek's Chronicler, Historian meta-mind for Malifax the Lich King_. 

His feathered fingers stab at the scroll.

A dark being of ages past bound in death, a servant of Eladrin and Lich alike. I sent them into his grasp. Gods what have I done?!”

Torin swallows hard, glancing toward the storm-lashed window as though the road itself were about to swallow the world. “Then…” he murmurs, “they may already be too late. B b b b ut they have faced the dark before right?...right?”

Moonwing pushes back, nearly toppling his chair, panic written in every motion. “Not like this. If they’ve only just arrived—perhaps—perhaps there’s still a chance. Which way did they go?”

Torin lifts a trembling hand and points, toward the looming hills where the old ruins stand.

Without another word, Moonwing bolts back into the storm. The tavern falls into a hush, patrons staring at the door long after it swings closed, as though afraid of what shadow might follow.
