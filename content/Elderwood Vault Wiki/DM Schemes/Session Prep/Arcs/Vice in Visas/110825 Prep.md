## **Five-Room Dungeon: Through the Mana Flood**

**Theme:** Erratic, malignant magic warps the environment like radiation. The deeper they go, the stranger and more dangerous it becomes.

---

### **Room 1 – The Blackstone Gate** _(Entrance & Guardian)_

- **Setup:** The party arrives at the massive sealed gate. Blackstone walls rise like cliffs, studded with rusted wards and anti-magic sigils. The guardhouse is abandoned but the air is unnervingly warm, carrying a faint metallic tang.
    
- **Challenge:** The gate’s wards are partially broken, and magic has begun to “leak” out. The lingering magic animates scraps of clothing, broken tools, and the skeletal remains of past trespassers into twitching, half-formed guardians.
    
- **Purpose:** Introduces the area’s dangers, lets players test abilities against unstable magic, and creates the sense that _even inanimate things are not safe here_.

### **Room 2 – Streets of Glass** _(Puzzle or Roleplay Challenge)_

- **Setup:** Cobblestone streets and brick facades are overgrown with strange, translucent crystal growths. They hum softly and shift color when approached, lighting the fog. The buildings’ reflections in the crystals sometimes _move differently_ from reality.
    
- **Challenge:** Players must find a safe route without touching unstable crystal clusters—contact risks magical backlash (polymorph effects, exploding light shards, or brief possession by past residents’ memories). Some clusters are unstable and can shatter into lethal rain.
    
- **Twist:** They may see the hermit’s reflection in a shard, implying he’s watching them—but the reflection’s lips form words they can’t hear.

### **Room 3 – The Chimera Pack** _(Trick or Setback)_

- **Setup:** A collapsed plaza, littered with market stalls now fused into grotesque shapes. Here, several warped denizens lurk—once human, now insectile or bestial hybrids. They are _not entirely hostile_; their intelligence flickers in and out.
    
- **Challenge:** The pack may attack, but can be bargained with. They demand food, tools, or a living “gift” in exchange for directions forward. If combat occurs, they use erratic magic surges (wild magic surges each round, some beneficial, most not).
    
- **Purpose:** Adds unpredictability, roleplay tension, and a reminder that the residents here were once people.

### **Room 4 – The Drowned Alley** _(Climax Battle or Hazard)_

- **Setup:** A sunken lane where the river has broken in, forming a flooded passage. The water is thick and oily, littered with strange floating debris—bones turned to coral, paper that doesn’t rot, candles burning underwater.
    
- **Challenge:** The river is alive with an arcane predator—a semi-corporeal eel-like thing made of current and light. It strikes from below, tries to pull victims under, and drags them toward submerged magic fissures.
    
- **Environmental Twist:** The party can use unstable magic in the area (floating candles, crystal debris) against the creature—if they’re willing to risk triggering dangerous magical side effects.

### **Room 5 – The Hermit’s Watch** _(Revelation & Reward)_

- **Setup:** Beyond the drowned alley, the path rises to a slanted bell tower overlooking the district. Inside, the hermit lives in a patchwork of scavenged rooms, surrounded by wards and charms that hum in counterpoint to the Flood’s magic.
    
- **Hermit:** An ancient, rail-thin figure—skin like wax, voice like rusted hinges—who speaks as if they’ve been expecting the party. They carry deep knowledge of the Flood, but speak in riddles, and their survival here is clearly _not natural_.
    
- **Reward:** The hermit can provide a vital map, secret, or lost artifact—but demands a task in return, one that will require the party to delve even deeper into the Flood in the future.
