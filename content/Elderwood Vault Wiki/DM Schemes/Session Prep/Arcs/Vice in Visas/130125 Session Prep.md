# Downtime Activities
## TBD
- 1 make a Cairn for Edna and Xol  
 Lepis are making a war memorial


- 2 Healer to heal the pain of the armour being fused to me but happy to leave it fused  

-The Rothgar pauldron seems to have fused.
-As if it somehow directed a killing blow to itself to save you. It is now laminated to the flesh but moves fluidly with it


- 3 Blacksmith to fix/upgrade my armour/buy new stuff (glowy armour would be cool) and/or improve HOLI  
Scalemail

- 4 Try and find chef to firstly see if he's alive and if I can learn anything more off him/get some ingredients   
- 5 top up on component casting ingredients
The Chef is dead but you search for some supplies for the road and come across a recipe book of theirs and 500sp worth of portable ingredients. You spend some time with Rasa's help to translate and copy it. There are many Lepi delicacies in there which you think might be possible on the material plane with a few substitutions. 
In the margins are notes on magical effects that can be imbued into these. 

The ingredients work for these

## Idril
- 1 Scry on Calvus
Much of what you saw in the cutscene, vision flits from moment to moment, as if skipping chunks of time.
seen secretly going into the synod church in a with a towering knight.
Begins to descend below, 
Notices the scrying, master we are being watched 

- 2 Fix Cloak ( when wrapped around your arm you can briefly shimmer through solid objects, costs 4 strain)
- 3 Craft more special arrows (Pick 4 of any type you already have)

## Brass Fist
- So... BF would like to locate Amagius and perhaps have a convo with him (we can maybe make a thread in the Disco), find out if there's anything else he should know about their little "deal" and if bringing him through the rift as well is all that he's looking for.
-Amagius preffers his involvement stay anonymous to Aequita, willing to offer a magic item in exchange for transportation


- If possible, he would also like to begin an investigation into what made him form into Broey that one time, as perhaps it's something that could be harnessed later and voluntarily
Last thing you remember before being broey was the explosion. The Aetheric leechstone charged from the raw magicks Actias and Tyria were casting were drawn through the stone and jumped to the nearest conductor for those energies. This you conclude charged something within you, possibly the other crystal clusters,  that bridged the gap between personalities allowing them to work in tandem. You suspect this was originally the intended function but something must have gone wrong, possibly during your escape. You surmise that your form as more abilities currently shut down and locked off from you due to this lack of charge. 

- Aaaand, he's taking up knitting and would like to make a very crude scarf as his first project
-mechanical precision like a printer 
## Acti
- K I thunked. I have some thing acti wants to do. They aren't necessarily like gonna give her any boosts But
- 
- She wants to adjust the lepidoptran robe she has on atm to have a sort of cape on the side she is missing a wing, nothing wildly fancy, just enough to balance the weight of the missing wing

- She wants to make a really short little story about a very brave Prince who was small and overlooked but commanded an army into battle (basically ask the nepti soldiers what happened and dramatise so nepti gets to be a hero in a story)
-
- No idea what the funerary rites of the air plane are so if I may, can I say that elders or important people have a song composed for them that is added to the songs played to maintain the plane? And if so acti would like to compose an Edna song :3 
-
- Hang out with Atlas, she wants to catch up properly without fear of death, happy to do it whilst clearing rubble if she needs to 
-RP this in chat 

- Idk go to the shellforge and see whether they can buff up her axe a little cos for sure that thing must be dented she's slammed it into so so many walls
