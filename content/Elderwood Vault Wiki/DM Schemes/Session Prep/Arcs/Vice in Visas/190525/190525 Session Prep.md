The Visas river slurped quietly at the hull as Ern and Brog dangled their lines into the black, eel-thick shallows. Above, the cathedral spires loomed like ribs of a dead god, their shadows slicing the moonlight. Brog chewed something—possibly tobacco, possibly a beetle. “Feels like a good night for eels,” he muttered. Ern nodded. Neither of them believed it.

The mist came in without ceremony, curling like old breath over the water. It brought with it the smell of wet stone and spoiled sermons. Brog squinted into it. “This ain’t the honest kind of fog.” Ern didn’t answer. He was already reeling his line in like it owed him money. The boat rocked. The river went silent, as though listening.

Then: a _thunk_, wet and deliberate, against the side of the skiff. A hand—grey, bloated, fingers like drowned roots—gripped the wood. It twitched. Brog made a noise like a kettle dying. Ern reached for the lantern, missed, and fell over the bait bucket. Something began to climb. The eels, wisely, disappeared.
