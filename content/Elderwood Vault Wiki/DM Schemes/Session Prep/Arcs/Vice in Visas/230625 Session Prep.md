Opening Cutscene 

Idril
Moonlight slicks the rooftops of Visas as Idril runs, boots skimming cracked tiles, rain bleeding off the eaves in steady streams. 
The city groans beneath her—the iron spires, the crooked chimneys, the distant bells tolling as if they know blood has been spilled this night and more death is to come.
Behind you the shadows ripple and twist unnaturally and blooming like mould Vanta steps from them, silent as the grave. 

Under her broken mask half her face can just be seen, pale almost stripped to bone wearing the bitter echo of a smile. 
“Always the martyr,” Vanta calls, voice dry as ash, “bleeding for your friends, the ones choking on _his_ fog.”
She grasps the night and from utter darkness pulls daggers of shadow, throwing them right for your heart. 
One big leap, almost on reflex takes you to the next roof and the blades shatter, missing you this time.
 Down below, the streets writhe with the Fell Mist, curling through alleyways, carrying the wet, crawling dead in its wake. 

You vault a crumbling parapet, landing hard on another roof slick with muck and the faint stink of rot. The groans of the dead echo down the cobbles—the others are still holding, for now, but you don't know how long they'll last.

The Mist clings to everything, steeped in necromantic rot, Calvus’ mark choking the city like a noose. This whole thing—the siege, the dead, the ruin—it’s his design. And Vanta? Just another of his puppets, a shadow of your friend fuelled by old grudges and worse magic. 
At last Salvation, a small brazier, covered and lit, baths a small crossroads of alleys in it's timid glow. You jump down seeking shelter in it's fragile light.

Nocking an arrow you eyes dart from shadow to shadow, anxiety building as you search for your target.  Vanta’s silhouette unfurls from the gloom, shadow blade in hand, eyes burning like silvery coals.
 “Where was this spirit when FOR ONCE I needed you” Vanta hisses at the light, the shadows closing tight around you. Idril what do you say? What can you do against the darkness?
