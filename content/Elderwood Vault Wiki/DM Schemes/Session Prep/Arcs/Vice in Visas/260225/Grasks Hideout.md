[[The 5 Room Dungeon Overview]]

[[Visas]]

### **The Moonfang Hideout**

A ruthless gang of smugglers and extortionists, the **Moonfangs** run illicit operations in the underbelly of **Visas**. Unbeknownst to most, they are all werewolves. Recently, they stole a forbidden tome on demonology—**"The Graven Lexicon"**—and now keep it hidden in their lair.

### **Room 1: The Den’s Gate (Entrance & Guardian)**

A seedy gambling hall and fighting pit serves as the **Moonfangs’ front**. The air reeks of sweat and ale. The gang members eye newcomers warily.

**Obstacle:** To gain access to the hideout proper, the players must either:

- Bluff their way in as gamblers, fighters, or buyers of illicit goods.
- Bribe or intimidate their way past the heavily muscled **doorman**, a scarred half-orc enforcer named **Gorran the Grinless**.
- Sneak in through the back, where chained-up mastiffs growl at intruders.

### **Room 2: The Carrion Altar (Puzzle or Roleplaying Challenge)**

The first chamber of the warren is a **wretched shrine** to Krauga, littered with gnawed bones and dripping with gore. A **mutilated corpse** hangs from the ceiling, its entrails arranged in eerie sigils.

**Challenge:** The only passage deeper is sealed by a **blood-warded door**, pulsing with dark magic.

- **A riddle of hunger** is scrawled in Abyssal—solving it reveals the way forward.
- **A blood sacrifice** (animal or humanoid) must be made to the gnoll shaman presiding over the shrine.
- **Destroying the altar** breaks the ward—but risks drawing demonic attention.



### **Room 3: The Feeding Pit (Trick or Setback)**

The players enter a cavernous pit where the **pack discards the unworthy**. Half-eaten bodies rot in the corners. The gnolls above have been waiting—**this is an ambush.**

**Complication:**

- A gnoll **beastmaster** unleashes a pack of **starving hyenas** to tear the party apart.
- The ground **collapses**, dumping the players into a **lower cavern full of feral ghouls**.
- The gnolls fight only to **weaken the players**—they want them captured for the **final ritual.**



### **Room 4: The Alpha’s Ascension (Climax & Big Conflict)**

At the heart of the lair, **Rask Bloodmaw**, the **Hollowclaw Alpha**, stands upon an ancient **demon-forged altar**. The **Graven Lexicon** is open before him, its pages glowing with abyssal energy. His body **bulges and twists** as he undergoes a **final transformation**, his form no longer merely a were-gnoll but something… **worse.**

**Combat & Dilemma:**

- The players can try to **interrupt the ritual**, but doing so might **shatter the altar**, releasing **pure abyssal energy.**
- Rask, now a **demon-infused Were-Gnoll Tyrant**, is nearly unstoppable—unless the players **use silver, destroy the Lexicon, or force the moonlight enchantment to backfire.**
- Any **PC who has been infected** may feel the **hunger taking hold**—will they fight it or embrace it?


### **Room 5: Escape & Consequence (Reward & Revelation)**

With Rask defeated, the lair **begins to collapse**, the abyssal power within it **destabilizing.**

- The players **recover the Graven Lexicon**, but it is **forever altered**—the pages now whisper of a **"great devourer"**, a being who will come for the Hollowclaw’s remnants… and those who **interfered.**
- Any **infected PCs** must now **battle their own growing bloodlust**—do they seek a cure, or do they **embrace their new form?**
- Survivors of the Hollowclaw may **scatter**, but one thing is certain—the curse **has spread** beyond this lair, and others will rise in Rask’s place.
