Calvus stands overlooking the carnage and panic his scheme has wrought and smiles.
The bodies of the apprentices fleeing the scene now littered the streets where Vanta and the Cryptguard has cut them down. Their blood pooling, flowing into the sewer grates.  

Zombies move in slowly after, to dispose of any evidence and meddlesome adventurers. What a pleasant surprise that had been. But no matter, they are insignificant next to scope of  what is to come.

"I owe you an apology Abbot, your ritual exceeds all expectations. Direct mastery of The Mist. It's quite something to behold."
A figure wearing a black cloak to conceal Synod robes bows
"Yes Master but impossible without your insight. Do...do you think it will be enough"

"Oh to scare the geriatrics in the college, yeeess I believe the wanton slaughter of a generation of apprentices who could have been saved if not for the necromancy ban should move even their glacier paced minds."

Calvus looks up towards the Pillar Meridian and smirks

"Oh my and on the night of Saint Derisor's proclamation, that will have them vexxed. Do you think that will be enough, no don't answer not nearly enough. We must choose our targets carefully. Each one calculated to bring hate, spite, fear and doubt to our dear friend's mind. Let them see the world they saved, let them see how futile their sacrifice was."





Calvus watches the chaos unfold beneath him. Screams echo. Smoke curls. He smiles.

Some of the apprentices had tried to flee. Just as planned. Vanta and the Cryptguard made sure they didn’t get far. Now their bodies paint the cobblestones, blood spilling thick into the gutters, the city drinking deep.

Zombies shuffle in, slow and methodical. They clear the debris—flesh, bone and attempt at the occasional hero. Unexpected resistance, briefly amusing. Irrelevant.

“I owe you an apology, Abbot,” Calvus says, voice smooth as oil. “Your ritual surpassed all expectations. Direct command of the Mist. Quite Beautiful really..”

A figure in black lowers his hood, revealing the hidden insignia of the Synod.

“Yes, Master. But only with your guidance. Do you... do you think it’s enough?”

“To terrify the crusted husks in the College? Oh, yes. A generation of would-be saviors butchered in the streets. All because of their precious necromancy ban. That should rattle their ivory cages.”

Calvus turns to the sky, where the Pillar Meridian looms like a spear aimed at heaven.

“And on the night of Saint Derisor’s proclamation... how poetic. No, don’t answer. It isn’t enough. Not nearly.”

He leans forward, voice low, eyes glinting.

“We’ll be precise. Every death, a blade. Hate, the whetstone. Spite, the handle. Let our noble friend watch the world he saved drown in rot. Let him choke on the futility of his sacrifice.”

Calvus takes a tome from the priest's fear weak hands.

"Worry not my friend, Damun will take care of you"


Meanwhile, trying desperately to not make the ultimate sacrifice themselves, our heroes are beset on all sides by the rotting undead.
