Opening Cutscene Wizards necromancy speech


Calvus
Lucius Malfoy Voice

The hubbub of the Crystal College council chamber in session. row upon row of tiered seating, two sides facing each other, a parliament of the mystic. Palacial in splendour with the air and tension of a courtroom.  Each magister sits dispensing sage wisdom and heated discussion. The noise grows, the wise exchange of ideas....the bickering. 

Archmage Galdradur glowers and taps their staff on the stonework around their throne. A glint from magical lights makes it almost seem alive, once struck it's long crystalline form rings clear like a fine bell silencing the hundreds amassed for this special session. 

A pale magister in dark robes stands and speaks "Archmage our arguments have met deaf ears and so if you are willing we call upon a new speaker"
She gestures to the entrance where the mural of Wizards of old, guardians of time battle long forgotten horrors is carved into two story tall doors.
The entrance opens as if inviting someone home. And Calvus walks in, unhooding his cloak and looking up at the assembled court of all that is Arcane.
He waits for the rampant whispers to die down then speaks.

"Archmage, My fellow Magisters, lords, ladies, wise and faithful stewards of the realm —

I ask you: how long shall we let fear dictate our future? How long shall we deny ourselves the mastery that is our birthright? Unlike our illustrous elven overlords, death overhangs all that we do. I say Death has ruled over us for too long. It is time we ruled over death.

Yes, I know the past you fear. I know the tales of reckless necromancers, The Lich Lords, who once brought ruin to our lands. But shall we, in trembling remembrance of their failures, forever abandon the very power that could redeem us? Shall we let the crimes of the undisciplined blind us to the salvation that lies at our fingertips?

It was not necromancy that corrupted them. It was their weakness. Division. Lack of vision. Lack of strong, guiding hands.

Necromancy — true necromancy, tempered by law and guided by wisdom — is no evil. It is the art of remembrance, the science of preservation, the foundation of an eternal peace.

Shall we ban the plow for fear it might become a sword? Shall we silence the scholar for fear he might lie? Shall we banish the healer for fear that he may poison? 
No! We do not destroy tools — we teach their use. We master them.

Imagine a realm where no hero is ever forgotten, where the wisdom of our ancestors whispers still in the halls of power, where loyalty endures beyond the grave and in service eternal.

Imagine a kingdom where the greatest minds of the past advise the rulers of the present; where the bravest soldiers of old defend our walls anew; where every citizen knows that death is not an end, but a new duty to the realm.

If we drive necromancy into the shadows, we give it to traitors and tyrants. But if we bring it into the light, we place it under our command. Better a dangerous servant than an unstoppable enemy.

You fear corruption — yet what is more corrupting than weakness? You fear tyranny — yet what is more tyrannical than death itself?

With strong hands to guide it, necromancy will not destroy freedom — it will perfect it. True peace cannot be left to the whims of mortal weakness. True loyalty must be made unbreakable.

I do not stand here to unleash anarchy. I stand here to forge an unshakable realm — a realm where the strong protect the weak, where order is absolute, where even The Grey Mare bends her knee to the will of the righteous.

Re-consecrate the school of necromancy. Regulate it. Strengthen it. Crown it with law. Place it in the hands of those worthy to wield it.

Fear binds. Knowledge frees. Let strength give birth not to terror — but to eternity.

Let us be remembered, not as the generation that cowered before power, but as the generation that mastered it with courage.

Let us rule not only the living — but destiny itself."





MAGISTER VALTOR
Old Deep Gandalf Voice

"Lords and ladies, do not be deceived by fine words and gilded promises.

He speaks of peace — with armies of the dead. He speaks of loyalty — from those with no will to refuse.

He tells you the old tyrants failed because they were weak. No — they failed because necromancy itself corrupts. Because to command the dead is to forget the living. Because no man who walks with corpses can hold life sacred for long.

He offers you a world without death, but it will be a world without freedom, without mercy, without soul.

He does not seek to guide you. He seeks to own you — in life, and after it.

Remember the bones beneath our fields. Remember the smoke that once blackened our skies. Remember the tyrants we tore down with blood and steel.

Necromancy is not a tool. It is a throne built from graves.

I say this now: better to fear death than to worship it. Better to die free than to live forever in chains."
