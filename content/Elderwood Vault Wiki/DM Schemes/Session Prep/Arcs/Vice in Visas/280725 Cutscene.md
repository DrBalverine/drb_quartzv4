**[CUTSCENE: “The Waking of Saint Derisor”]**

** Pillar Meridian Sepulcher OF THE SILVER FLAME – NIGHT**

A cavernous church of devout dread. Cold stone, grey light. A throne, old stone cracked like  the scars of time. Blue vapour curls from it's base. The occupant stirs. _Saint Derisor_—once knight, martyr, paragon—now risen, lordly and still as the stone. Eyes faintly aglow. Armor tarnish but opulent, battle scared but ornate. A relic once again given purpose.

Before them stands _Varchess Maelle_, Speaker of the Synod. Candlelight dances in his rings. He fidgets nervously. A ruse, he and his secret master have prepared for this moment with monastic patience and a reliable guile.

He bows, shallowly. Anything deeper would be undignified. Or encouraging.

**VARCHESS MAEL**  
My saint. We welcome your request. It seems time has treated you with the reverence the living could not but alas much has come about since your ..... absence.

_(He watches the saint's face. No movement. Not even disdain. Good. Or bad. Hard to say.)_

---

They told him Derisor would be wrath incarnate. They failed to mention wrath could be silent and evidently patient. Mael adjusts the clasp of his robe and steps closer, voice warm, hands folded like a penitent serpent.

---

**VARCHESS MAEL**  
Much and little has changed. The Lich Lords lie in ruins, yes. Your sword did not miss its mark. The Silver Knights fell but fell gloriously. And then—well. You people are people.

_(No reaction. Not even the twitch of a gauntlet. Mael continues.)_

---

**VARCHESS MAEL**  
For a time, we were united. Grieving but Inspired. But then the necromancers' chains were gone, and with them—so was the order to their lives and all that made it possible. We burned their black grain, lest it poison our minds longer. But as a final insult from the dead ones, the land rotted faster than the corpses that had watered it. Famine and pestilence ruled in the stead of the old masters.

_(Still nothing. But the light in Derisor’s eyes flickers. He leans into it—gently, like easing open a wound.)_

---

**VARCHESS MAEL**  
Brother fought brother for bread. The War of Muck. That is what the elves called it. Never let a crisis pass without a snide remark. Civil war, hunger, plague. We warred over the slop that could one day feed us. The kingdom a churning pit of mud. And in the mud, the populus began whispering... that at least the Lich Lords brought order. Predictable doom. Easier to plan around.

_(A small shift in the saint’s posture. Mael almost smiles. Almost.)_

---

He must not gloat. Gloating is for amateurs and..... ghosts. He must offer truth like poisoned wine—sweet, vintage, and entirely drinkable.

---

**VARCHESS MAEL**  
The Council of Dukes rose from the mire. Carpe Jugulum if you will forgive the Sanginestri.  Built just enough to keep the nobles noble. But as we dared to stand once more, Then came the elven tithe—coin, grain, conscripts. Rebuilding turned to rationing. Rationing turned to riots. Hope became expensive.

_(Derisor’s gaze darkens. Mael takes one more step.)_

---

**VARCHESS MAEL**  
And just when the bleeding started to scab, civilisation returning to what had been dreamed of under the skeletal thumb... the Psychic Wars. A dragon—amethyst, grandiose and appallingly —declared war on thought itself. Cities devolved. Minds unraveled. Our spoke only mostly speak in birdsong and migraine.

---

He lets silence settle again. Lets the full picture fester.

---

In truth, Mael has waited years for this. Not for Derisor’s return, but for the opportunity it presents. A disappointed saint is far more dangerous than a triumphant one. Derisor expected hymns. Statues. A world reborn.

They will find only rot and a kingdom too exhausted to care.

And with them, the Synod's foundation cracks.

---

He speaks now in a hush. Final words. Careful as surgery.

---

**VARCHESS MAEL**  
We remembered you. Quietly. Conveniently. No statues, no songs. But prayers. Whispered, never sung. In case they were overheard.

_(The saint turns, ever so slightly. The light in their eyes is not holy. Not now.)_

---

He feels it, the temperature dropping. A presence growing denser. The way storms gather at sea—without sound, only intent.

Mael bows again, slightly deeper this time.

---

**VARCHESS MAEL**  
We... are so very glad to have you back.

_(A pause. A crackle in the air like old thunder. Derisor steps down from the throne. Each step a sentence unspoken.)_

---

Mael straightens, very carefully. He smiles.

---

_Let them fear their savior. Let him remind them why the dead once ruled._
