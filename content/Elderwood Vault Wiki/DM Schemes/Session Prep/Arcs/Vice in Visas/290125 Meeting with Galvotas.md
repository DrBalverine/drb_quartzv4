## Strong Start  
  RENDER SMELL SEE TOUCH FEEL
Toby nightmare of being chased through ancient tunnels by a shadow wearing his armor.
Trying to follow signs, runes one will lead you 
A sputtering torch your only light in the darkness, 
cold dread ABSOLUTE FEAR grips as the flame fails, it seems the darkness holds more terrors than the being chasing you. 
Running Triggering traps and running through but the apparition following, tanking the traps, 
Many twists and turns, a half remembered route, some signs to lead you
unexpected T, left or right, left or right THIS WASN'T THE PLAN
open into a cavern, a long thin stone arch now the bridge, 
you light the brazier and the runic door door glows
"speak the words etched upon thine heart"
you panic and words fumble out in incoherently
Nothing happens, the apparition reaches the bridge closing in.
  finally speak the words and the runes glow, the door opens, hope burns in your heart you turn and run
  All too late you see the figure on the other side of the door, Calvus, crackling necrotic energy engulfs you and you awaken in panic
