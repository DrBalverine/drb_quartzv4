What am I?"_

**Riddle of Souls**  
_"I weigh nothing, yet tip the scales.  
I flee in silence when flesh fails.  
Dark chains of lords keep me bound,  
seek me where the mists are found.  
What am I?"_

The chamber of Outpost V is windowless, its silver-leafed walls etched with wards to prevent eavesdropping. Ward-seals crawl like veins across the walls, witch lamps pulsing whenever a voice is raised. A round obsidian table reflects the pale faces of the Bureau’s officers. Each wears a muted green cloak or grey uniform, their sigil hidden discreetly in the design.

**Director Clarion:**  
“Saint Derisor the Reborn will speak at The Champions Call. The Praetor’s word is clear: the proclamation must not weaken the Soverignty’s hand. We would know their intent before they opens their mouth. I need not remind you their words carry the weight of prophecy. The crowds will listen. If she questions the Sovreignty, even in parable, it will spread like rot.””

**Watcher Maerin:**  
“And yet the the Ambassador insists on attending in person. Her safety alone would justify sealing the plaza and placing Derisor under protective custody. I need not remind who's granddaughter they are.”

**Calirion:**  
(grim) “Do not be so blunt Watcher, we are not working in Sovreignty territory, a scalpel is required not a hammer. The Ambassador forbids such measures regardless. Her presence is a message to the provinces — She will not appear afraid of a dusty prophet.”

**Ranger Siral:**  
“There are whispers the necromancer cult plans to mar the ceremony. If we are denied the right to act, the festival may become a unmanageable.”

**Clarion:**  
“The Ambassador’s orders are law. We observe only. Should the cult act, we respond — but not before.”

**Maerin:**  
“And the matter of the rogues? Three of our own now lost and unaccounted for. Reports say at least one now operates in the city, off-ledger.”

**Calirion:**  
“Unconfirmed. If they exist, they will surface. Their interference will be met as treason.”

**Watcher Tythis:**  
“Derisor himself is warded. We cannot move against the Synod so publically. Our augurs taste only fragments of their dreams, more nightmares of the Lich Lords — shadow, chains, spite. Nothing we can use but They are not the saint they proclaim to be”

**Calirion:**  
“Then we tighten the net. The Saint’s retinue is to be shadowed day and night. Every pilgrim who enters the Dawn Plaza is to be recorded. I want Every whisper traced.”

_He lets his gaze travel around the table; each officer stiffens beneath it._

**Calirion:**  
“Remember: our duty is not to prophecy, nor to the festival, nor even to the Synod. We serve the Domina’s will. No voice, living or dead, will be allowed to sway it.”

_The witch-lamps flare as the ward-seals bind the order to silence; the Bureau’s officers rise as one, saluting the iron star emblem before departing to their work._
