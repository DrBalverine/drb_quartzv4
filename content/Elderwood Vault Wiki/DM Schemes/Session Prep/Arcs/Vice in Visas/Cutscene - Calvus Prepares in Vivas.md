### Visas in the Hour of the Wolf

_(Meanwhile in Visas, we see a darkened stone corridor. The walls are ornately carved in the Vissian royal style, but they are old, cracked, and deeply weathered. Time has turned splendor into squalor; damp streaks mar the stone, and faint rivulets drip into unseen pools. All is silence and darkness save for the skittering of a rat. Its tiny claws echo in the gloom as it pauses, sniffing the air. Then, it watches with unsettling intent as two shadows materialize in the corridor.)_

**Narration:** (Optional) _"The Hour of the Wolf descends, Nigh is the time for dark deeds and the players move their pieces across the board"

_(The Acolytes step forward, their movements unnaturally fluid, their sable kebbit wraps muffling their steps. The rat retreats into the shadows but lingers, its beady eyes glinting faintly in the dim light. For a brief moment, its gaze seems too knowing, too deliberate. The cultists proceed purposefully, the air around them heavy with unspoken menace.)_

_(They approach a large iron-studded wooden door. The sight hatch scrapes open, revealing two ivory, eyeless sockets—empty yet alive with flickering green embers. Recognition glimmers within them before the door groans open. The cultists step inside.)_

_(The chamber beyond is a macabre study. Bones are stacked in disorganized masses upon stone shelves, their haphazard arrangement resembling a grotesque library. The faint stench of decay hangs in the air overpowered just by ongoing alchemy. A large desk, upon closer inspection, is a stone sarcophagus. Seated before it is_ **_Magister Calvus_**_, silhouetted against the faint glow of a smoldering brazier. His hooded robes are trimmed with mink, a rich defense against the frost that clings to the city’s bones. Such is Winterveil in Visas. The flickering firelight dances over his face, casting deep, shifting shadows.)_

_(The door closes with a resounding_ __thump___, the sound swallowed by the oppressive silence. The cultists bow their heads briefly before speaking.)_

**Cultist 1:** "Master Calvus, we have scouted and sealed the nearby tunnels. This refuge will be secure for now. The criers claim the Laughing Plague is contained, but this is a lie. The nobility's partitioning of the infected districts is merely a stalling measure. Half the Moonlight District is now 'contained' so they claim. 

**Cultist 2**: The Warrens are cut off,  no watchmen dare make the crossing to patrol it. By all logic, the plague should have overtaken it weeks ago. But we… we’ve seen no signs of infection during our missions."

**Master Calvus:** _(Leaning forward, his voice low and dangerous)_ "There were three of you."

_(The cultists exchange uneasy glances. The second cultist steps back slightly, nudging his companion forward.)_

**Cultist 1:** _(Nervously)_ "Yes, Master… uh, you tell him."

**Cultist 2:** _(Hissing)_ "I’m not—"

**Master Calvus:** _(Slamming his gloved hand on the sarcophagus)_ "SPEAK! Or your corpses shall finish the tale."

_(The cultists flinch. The first one quickly steps forward and throws down an open sack. The contents spill onto the floor: a severed hand, bloodied and grotesque. Marks of the Lich Lord Cult adorn its fingers, their necromantic designs unmistakable. The flesh is charred and sulphurous, the wrist ragged, chewed apart. A burnt brand—a "T"—mars the back of the hand.)_

**Cultist 1:** _(Voice trembling)_ "The Flind Street leader sends… a gift."

_(Master Calvus regards the severed hand with cold detachment. His fingers drum once against the edge of the sarcophagus before he speaks.)_

**Master Calvus:** "I see. Withdraw our people from active work in that district. Observation only, for now. Until the business with the King is resolved, we cannot afford distractions. Afterwards… perhaps Vanta should pay them a visit, when she is finished in golden house . Continue your report."

**Cultist 1:** _(Nodding quickly)_ "Yes, Master. As I was saying, the ruined Undercity presents a critical weakness. The tunnels beneath the city run deeper than anyone dares explore. Only the King knows their full extent, yet his demands grow ever more erratic. If even one unsecured cellar or waste-way remains, the plague will find its way through. Yet our excavations continue as per your orders"

**Cultist 2:** "We’ve done as you asked, Master. Rumors spread like wildfire. The populace blames elven negligence—or malice—for the plague. Those in power suspect the Troupe, believing they’ve been bought by the Sovereignty to orchestrate this chaos. A ploy to reconquer the [[human]] realms after their losses in the north. All our fabrication of course, they seemed to want to believe it already"

**Cultist 1:** "Lady Visas remains silent, as ever. Our work in the Mist Quarter progresses. The dark powers there grow restless, rallied by ritual. She is distracted, diminished. Meanwhile, we grow stronger."

**Master Calvus:** _(Turning slightly, his voice a whisper that cuts through the cold)_ "And the College?"

**Cultist 2:** "In turmoil, Master. Word has reached us that Scryers' Keep… has fallen. Suicides by the dozens, murders rampant. Cleaners were dispatched to scrub blood-written runes from every surface."

**Master Calvus:** _(Narrowing his eyes)_ "The runes. What did they say?"

**Cultist 2:** "A single phrase, scrawled thirty times in the main hall alone: _Hark the Voiceless Talkers. Like an avalanche, so comes the end. Retrace the steps of the Gemstone Tyrant. What they feared is here_"

**Master Calvus:** _(His gaze darkens)_ "And their motive?"

**Cultist 2:** "Unknown, Master. But the staff whisper that the air still echoes with… voices."

_(Master Calvus stands, his silhouette looming as the fire behind him flares briefly.)_

**Master Calvus:** _(Tossing a small seal to the cultists)_ "Take this. Recover the tomes on this list while their eyes are dim."

**Cultist 1:** _(Hesitating)_ "But Master… the Candlewights…"

**Master Calvus:** _(Leaning in, his voice like iron)_ "Obey. I do not tolerate mysteries. An unknown is a threat. Remember your souls are safe with me." _(He steps back into the shadow.)_ "Now, continue."

**Cultist 2:** _(Swallowing hard)_ "Yes, Master. All this… it strengthens the Synod’s cause. Each sermon stokes the flames of rebellion. Saint Malpris the Reborn plans holy marches through the city. Our whispers inciting schism have taken root."

_(We see the rat as it scurries back into the darkness, its eyes glinting one final time. For the briefest instant, its silhouette against the faint firelight seems… unnatural. Unseen, it slips through the cracks, vanishing into the unknown depths below. A faint sound—a skitter, a whisper, a laugh—echoes in the cold silence.)_

_(Master Calvus turns back toward the brazier. He steps forward, his voice low but brimming with dark confidence as he begins to speak. The cultists freeze, their heads bowed in reverence.)_

**Master Calvus:**  _"The King plays his games of shadow and steel, grasping at secrets he cannot hold. The College stumbles, blindfolded by its own arrogance, and the Synod rots from within, their sermons like kindling for a flame they do not control. They clutch at threads, each convinced they pull the loom._
_But none see the tapestry we weave. None hear the quiet closing of jaws, the slow, inevitable march of the tide. By the time they look up from their petty squabbles, it will be too late. They are already ensnared—pawns in a game they have not even begun to play. The Laughing Plague is but the opening act, a single note in the symphony of their downfall._

_(He pauses, gazing into the flickering brazier as though seeing something distant yet certain.)_

_"Let them march. Let them preach. Let them rot in their castles of dust and bone. By the time they realize the wolf is among them, it will have already feasted."_

_(He turns sharply to the cultists, his voice dropping to a razor’s edge.)_

_"Go now. There is much yet to do"_

(He turns to his skeletal servant as the cultists rush away into the night)

"Bring me the soul cage and Synod robes.....we are going to church"

_(Scene fades to black.)_
