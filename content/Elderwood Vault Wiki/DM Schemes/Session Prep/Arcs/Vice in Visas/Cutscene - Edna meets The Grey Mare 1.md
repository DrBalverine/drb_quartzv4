**Edna meets The Grey Mare**

*Death is a doorway.  The first step to innumerable paths.  It is prudent to prepare your route, but do not worry, for there is a guide.*

*We see Palace Tyria, it's dark stone and living clay.  We hear the rumble of thunder followed by a blinding flash of the astral storms.*

*As we draw closer, the sounds of battle ring out, the Palace dungeon alive with chaos.*

*We hear their cries of triumph…turn to cries of utter despair.*

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Edna, you…stand up.  

The coldness imparted by the stone floor beneath you begins to dissipate, though there is an ache in your chest—a hollow reminder of your end— that fades a little slower.

You step out of a growing pool of crimson at your feet and pull your shawl around you against the ghostly chill.

A muted, grey-green light now bathes the scene as you take stock. The shadows in the Palace dungeon are long and dark, threatening to eclipse everything.

You dare not look behind you. You know who lies there.

You knew what you were doing and have no regrets.

As you take in the hazy scene before you, the sound of voices…your friends’ voices: muffled, distorted, as if heard through deep water.

But suddenly, much more prominent, is the sound of hooves on stone.  Sharp and rhythmic, they echo closer. The rhythm is unrelenting, but there is no sense of urgency.

You peer into the gloom for the source and find two white shining eyes meeting yours.  Eyeshine like that of an animal, but taller, moving with a fluidity that defies comprehension.

A feeling of…_expectancy_ overcomes you, as if you are being called from a waiting room.

A voice, familiar and kind, calls to you. It is the voice you had longed to hear, a voice that carries a tone of assurance, of inevitability, as if this meeting had been fated since your first breath.




_"**My dear Edna, come now, sit with me.**"_




The voice resonates not in your ears, but within your very being, striking a chord so deeply rooted it feels as though it has always been there, waiting to be plucked.

As your eyes focus, you see that the two glowing orbs hover above a crude table and chairs, fashioned from silver birch branches lashed together with twine, adorned with clusters of scarlet berries.

You take another step forward, and the dungeon dissolves to that of a small cottage kitchen. The cold, damp air gives way to the faint scent of spring blooms and the warmth of candlelight. The pale glow of moonlight filters through an unseen window, casting gentle shadows.

The transformation is almost imperceptible, but with each step, the chaos of the past fades into something more intimate, more…_introspective_. The table feels impossibly familiar somehow, as if you’ve sat here before…in another life.

Sitting down, you are enveloped by the strange luminescence that clings to the scene. Only then do you see the full form of the being opposite you across the table.

The collector. The guide. _The Grey Mare._

Towering over you,12 feet tall, their skeletal form is draped in an unending cascade of white shawl that pools upon the ground. The bright starlight eyes are set within the sockets of a horse’s skull, its pale surface etched with intricate, ancient runes that shimmer faintly in rhythm with their speech.

A wreath of spring crowns the skull, bursting with vibrant flowers and greenery. Ribbons of brilliant colour cascade down from the crown, their movement seemingly caught in the wind. You watch as an occasional petal falls, withers mid-air, and lands on the tabletop like a fragment of decay. Though it seems impossible for a being like this to breathe, you think you hear the faintest sigh. With it, the blackened petal crumbles to dust and vanishes on the breeze.

Within the cascading robes lies only endless darkness, a void that hints at a power far greater than the form they have chosen.

The great skull tilts, its glowing eyes regarding you. It does not look at your body; it peers beyond, into the very _essence_ of you.

A skeletal hand emerges from the robes, its joints creaking faintly as long fingers proffer an empty chalice in your direction.




**_"You had better get out your brandy, my love; this is not a talk to be had dry."_**




You retrieve the special reserve—purely medicinal of course—and fill the chalice.

The Grey Mare reclines slightly as they take the cup, no less imposing given their relaxed posture.

As they sip from the cup, the ivory maw somehow savouring the act, the Grey Mare speaks again.




**"Edna dear, your rest is well-deserved, but I cannot take you to the thereafter yet. It is not yet time for judgment."**

**"Be glad, little one. It is humbling for the gods that you can still find ways to confound them.  By Nithra and Xarphious’ will, I must be here. But I am inclined to return you."**




As they gesture towards the cottage door, you look down and realize the chalice is now in your hands. The transition was seamless, as if it had always been there.

Upon the table sits the Collar of Xolganath, at last removed. It gleams with an unnatural solidity, its presence more real than anything else in the room. From it emanates the voices of your friends, faint and distorted. You know they call for you, but their words are just beyond reach, tethered to a place you can no longer touch.

The Grey Mare’s glowing eyes narrow slightly, a gesture more contemplative than menacing.




**"Another pair, unknowing of each other, conspires to keep you here. Great power and sacrifice from both, all to bend my ear. This juncture is rife with troubles, and your death here a pebble under the wheel."**



The Mare’s skeletal hand gestures toward you, the chalice growing heavier in your grip. The shadows cast by the candlelight writhe and stir as their voice deepens slightly, carrying the same weight.




**"Hold your soul as an eternal concern, Edna dear. The cycle cleanses, but it is you who shape the path. Drink deep, my dear, and sleep. My Groom will see you right."**




As you lift the chalice, the liquid within shimmers like moonlight on water. You drink, and as the taste lingers—both sweet and bitter—the world tilts.

The darkness embraces you, not as an enemy, but as a mother comforting her child. You drift into sleep, the sound of hooves retreating echoing faintly in the distance.

You dream of an orchard under a burnt orange sky. The sound of crackling flame in all directions

XOL: "EDNA..........IS THAT YOU, ARE YOU ..... ALRIGHT?"
