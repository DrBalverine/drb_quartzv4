"You wretched, faithless lot! Have you learned nothing from the ruin of ages past? 
Time and again, the righteous have warned you, and yet you persist—wallowing in vice, bartering honor for gold, casting aside duty for fleeting pleasures.
And now, when the storm breaks over your heads, you wail and beg for mercy. But mercy is for the faithful!

This calamity is no great surprise, no cruel twist of fate—it is judgment! A reckoning upon a city that has forgotten the price of salvation. What was sacrificed for the freedoms you now exploit. 
You call upon the gods in your hour of need, but where was your devotion when times were easy? Where was your piety when the warnings were spoken?

Hear me now! The sacred halls of our grand cathedral, the very threshold to heaven’s grace, are closed to you all. 
The path to salvation is not walked with empty words, nor are the gates of the righteous thrown open for the unworthy. 
Prove yourselves! Show devotion as your ancestors did, and perhaps then—_perhaps_—the light will shine upon you once more."
