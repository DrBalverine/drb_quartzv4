There is no water on the Desiccated Isle but The Great Vein, the main river of the island, runs red with blood.
The source of The Great Vein is a blood spring created by [[The Vermillion Shroud]], the ancient elusive progenitor and master of all vampires. 
The [[Vampires of The Desiccated Isle]] have "conquered" the limitations of the curse. The upper class of vampires may now freely move in daylight by painting themselves in gold, which deflects its deadly light.
As such, they have substantial trade with the dwarves who mine it. With their unlimited source of blood, they have greatly advanced blood magic and as a result, become resistant to its corruption.

The Desiccated Isle is small but very well defended. Apart from the vampires themselves, powerful mages and the sand guard, the military of the desiccated isle is [[The Gilded Legion]], however, they have not been seen in living memory. According to the history books, it is a VAST army of indomitable golden clad beings. It is assumed that the [[Crimson Court]], the ruling council of powerful vampire lords who rule in [[the Vermillion Shroud]]'s absence, now controls this force. 
Vampires do not turn to dust instantly if they are hit by sunlight, but they initially become very weak, especially susceptible to all damage.
In time they will decay, rotting quickly and their flesh peels from their bones and they will end up losing their minds if they are in that skeletal state for too long.
However, the touch of blood can begin to restore them. Vampiric immortality leads many to a life of hedonism and decadence as their thirst for distraction is almost equal to their thirst for blood.

There is a strict hierarchy structure on the desiccated isle. It's citizens are group into either
- Lord (the ruling elite, the wealthy, the powerful),
- Thrall (Those who serve the lords in more advanced positions, warriors, traders, researchers musicians, most non-menial work)
-  Slave (The lowly and owned portion of society).
These chattels are disposable and insignificant). While this caste system is strict, ambition is often smiled upon if the individual is deserving. It is not uncommon for individuals to move up or down this system through great feats or failure or sabotage.
Aside from in the great cities, there is little life left on the Desiccated Isle and what remains has adapted to ceaseless unending struggle for survival. The only other native species to the isle are the nomadic [[Gnoll]] tribes, whom skirt the coastlines and venture into the dunes to hunt the isle's monsters and the city dwelling, scheming Yuan Ti largely eclipsed by the ever-growing [[human]] population and beholden to the incumbent vampire lords.
