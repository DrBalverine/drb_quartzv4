Small village near [[Crossroads]]. Roses here were blessed by [[Kepheros]] to quell the lingering power of a ruined temple to [[Taefana]]. The petals of these roses are also powerful alchemical reagents.

[[Calvus Sarconis]] stole a powerful idol from this temple and in doing so awoke [[Noxica Defilis]] The dormant Naga priestess of Taefana.
Noxica was defeated by [[The Party]] but Calvus (wounded) escaped to Crossroads.
