An [[Eladrin]] research institute specialising in the trans planar parasitic flora Bloodwood.

Their onieromancer went insane after looking into the Far Realms and merged themselves with the Bloodwood in order to draw power from the planes. They went dormant slowly regrowing untill their grove was disturbed by Human logging.

[[Alric Passkey]] a brass elf portal researcher had stolen Ancestor Wood for their portal experiments, wood which [[Yarrick]] a Wyld Elf druid needed to stop the Bloodwood spread. 
This put them into contact with [[The Party]] who were guarding Alrics caravan.

Chasing the stolen ancestor wood lead the party to The Bloodwood academy and eventually they aided Yarrick in defeating the Bloodwood Provost.
