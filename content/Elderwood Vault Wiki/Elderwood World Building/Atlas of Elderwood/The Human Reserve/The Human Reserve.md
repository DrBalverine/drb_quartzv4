The Human Reserve:

- [[Cordagh Citadel]], a mighty fortress capital of [[the Human Reserve]]. The great citadel similar to Minas Tirith. It sits outside of the Forest of Ancestors which covers most of Elderwood and is surrounded by farmland.
- [[Visas]], Seat of knowledge and religion for Elderwood. This dark broody city is split into many districts the most notable being, The Crystal College: The foremost institute of wizardry, [[The Synod]]: The great cathedral district, The Grim: a haunted area cursed by a magical accident, The Palace District: Where nobles and Lady Visas the city's enigmatic ruler live, The Warrens: a great underbelly of the city made up of numerous uncharted tunnels.
- [[Gravesford]], A major settlement of the Lich Lords who used to rule [[the Human Reserve]] until a rebellion vanquished them. It sits on a river and was a place of major industry for them.
- [[Roc Fell]], a tall mountainous region that houses the citadel of the hawklords (an aarakokra-like species), agents of the god of justice train here.
- [[Briarspring]], a small village that sits on top of an evil temple. A priest of the nature god planted magical roses around the town's water supply that wards off the evil from below. The players have defeated the priestess of this temple and everything is fine now. The temple also houses a locked door to [[the deep dark]].
- [[Crossroads]], sitting in the middle of many trade routes and at a good rest stop for a journey through the forest of ancestors Crossroads is a prosperous town where most will pass through at some time when journeying around elderwood.
- [[Kher Muldur]], the surface side fortress of the dwarves where they trade with other peoples. Kher Muldur has extensive mines and long underground canals which allow shipments of goods almost anywhere in elderwood.
- [[Korag Fens]], a large swamp and marshland with a few settlements such as the town called Korag, Bogwood and the ruined Doud. The primary industries of this area revolve around peat and crime.
- [[Shar Mzark]], the hub of the [[Brass Elves]] civilisation where magical and technological wonders can be found. The [[Brass elves]] are slightly isolationist and use [[fabricants]] (similar to warforged) for most mundane tasks. This is one of many [[Brass Elves|Brass Elf]] colonies but most are lost and forgotten. There is a city built around where Shar Mzark meets the surface overground called [[Cogdoor]].
