**The Mana Flood**  

District Almanac for the Discerning Visian 

Once, the Mana Flood was the beating heart of Visas’ arcane trade—a warren of glassblowers, alchemists, and mages who tested their wares in public for the price of a coin. That was all before the Sorcerers’ War. Before the night the sky tore open and the gutters ran with spells gone sour. Before every experiment, every charm, every petty act of street magic was left to ferment in the broken air.

Now, the district is sealed by blackstone walls and cold iron gates no key may open. The magic here did not fade—it thickened. It seeps into brick and marrow alike, invisible as air but heavy as lead. Its effects are cruel and without pattern: a coinflip of power or ruin. Those who bathe in it too long may wake to find their body not their own, their limbs lengthened into insectile stilts, their shadows writhing independently, or their voices replaced by the screams of birds.

The few who remain are scavengers, hermits, deserters and debtors, criminals too dangerous—or too valuable—to kill. Without protection, most are unmade, bodies and minds twisted into things that prowl the drowned streets on moonless nights. The water itself runs strange here, slow and viscous, carrying with it shards of crystal, bones calcified into porcelain, and the occasional disembodied eye that drifts like a seedpod, ever watchful still.

From the walls, the Mana Flood seems still. Silent. But step inside, and you will find the air charged, your teeth aching with the pressure of unseen tides. Somewhere within, the magic hums, as though the district itself remembers the war—and is waiting for it to begin again.
