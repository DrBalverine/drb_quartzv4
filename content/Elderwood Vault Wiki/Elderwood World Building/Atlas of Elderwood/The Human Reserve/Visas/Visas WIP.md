# Districts Overview

## 1: The Moonlight District 
- An entertainment and market district. By day hustle and bustle of markets and artisan workshops. At night home to several small theatres, taverns, and inns. Named after the late night activities of the district, pale magical orbs illuminating the revelry and to some the cobbled streets seem to bare the pattern of the moon phases.

## 2: The Warrens 
- Poorer densely populated, under control of criminals based out of Flind Street.

## 3: High Perch Estates 
- More affluent |area outside the walls where noble estates, manors and grounds overlook the city from the hill. Their occupants both figuratively and literally looking down on the general populous. 

## 4: Crowfoot Terrace 
- Main centre for exchange in the city. Where incoming and outgoing trade caravans are prepared. Multitudes of stalls, shops, and warehouses. General understanding is that the district earned its name due to the overlapping “claw-like” alleys radiating from its central plaza. Historians will also note the main tradehall being repurposed from an eladrin Corvax stable. Also home to a number of guildhalls influential to the city.

## 5: The Mist 
- A whole district locked down and abandoned due to a horrible catastrophe, it is still horribly haunted to this day, that occasionally spills over into other areas. Criminals can request a "Trial by Mist" wherein they are made to spend a night in The Mist and if they survive they are acquitted.

## 6: The Manaflood

## 7: Shardspire Ward 
- Large residential and commercial district dominated by a wizard academy wherein they study crystal shards left over from a war with a psionic gemstone dragon.

## 8: Coronet Parade 
- Area for the municipal and military factions. Coronet Parade refers to both the crown (who they serve) but also the hooves of cavalry and the soldiers plumes, made from coronet bird feathers. They parade as a show of force but also this area houses jousting arenas and other sports wherein nobles gain favour.


## 9: Lantern Veil Wharf 
- More respectable docklands, hub of industry and trade. Lantern Veil refers to the numerous lanters that hang like bunting crisscrossing the streets here so work can go on all through the night.

## 10: Duskridge Crossing 
- Westerly entrance to the city, this area sits outside the walls and refers to crossing the moat river around the city. 

## 11: Arx Regnatrix 
- Residence of Lady Visas enigmatic ruler of the city and the area also houses her government and noble court.

## 12: The Fangs 
- Docklands named after the two large towers that dominate it, remnants from larger fortifications long gone now.

## 13: Sableston Cross 
-  Hub for the city’s working-class artisans and craftsmen, their families and necessary utilities to keep the city running.

## 14: Fellview Village 
- Village overlooking rolling hills to the north west of [[Visas]]. Large farming community likely under the thumb of their noble landlords.

## 15: Pillar-Meridian 
- Central Island where the Synod and Crystal College have their HQ. Named after a literal translation of the elven name for the place.

## 16: Elverpot Cove 
- Poorer area docklands, known for eel fisheries and smuggling.

## 17: Willowmere 
-  Affluent residential district with tranquil canals, tree-lined streets, and elegant townhouses home to merchants and minor nobles. Known for the Willow Promenade and boutique artisan workshops, it exudes quiet prosperity. Beneath its charm, rivalries and clandestine dealings hint at hidden tensions. Wherever there are nobles and money you will find Flind Street and The Troupe.

## 18: The Spelt Belt 
- Noble estates, likely landowners, named after the spelt for farming and its gold colour indicating wealth.

## 19: The Undercity 
- The labyrinth of tunnels and abandoned buildings beneath the city, now home to monsters but with many forgotten treasures to find.

1. The Moonlight District

A lively area situated close to the river, known for its vibrant nightlife and cultural gatherings. By day, the district features a mix of market squares and artist workshops. By night, the area transforms into a haven for minstrels, performers, and revelers, illuminated by magical moonlit globes hanging from wrought iron streetlamps. The district is home to several small theatres, taverns, and inns. Its name comes from both its nocturnal charm and the legend of a tragic bard who sang to the moon, haunting the area with their melodies.

Key Features:

    A famous open-air amphitheater hosting plays and duels of wit.
    Artisan shops selling fine wares, magical trinkets, and exotic goods.
    Streets known for their cobbled patterns resembling moon phases.

4. Crowfoot Terrace

The city’s primary merchant and trade hub, Crowfoot Terrace is a densely packed warren of narrow streets lined with stalls, shops, and warehouses. The district earned its name due to the overlapping “claw-like” alleys radiating from its central plaza. Merchants and artisans compete for space here, offering everything from spices to enchanted curiosities. The terrace also houses a prominent guildhall for traders and a clock tower that marks the start and end of the trading day.

Key Features:

    A bustling central market square.
    Guild offices and merchant houses.
    A "Bargain Bell" rung at midday to signal sales or auctions.

13. Sableston Cross

An area of industry and infrastructure, Sableston Cross is a hub for the city’s working-class artisans and craftsmen. Named for its distinctive pale stonework, the district is a maze of workshops, smithies, and warehouses. Sableston Cross is vital to Visas, producing weapons, tools, and other essential goods. Despite its utilitarian nature, the district is not without charm, with intricate carvings on many buildings showcasing the pride of its artisans.

Key Features:

    The Great Forge: A massive communal smithy powered by enchanted bellows.
    Rows of brick kilns, dye houses, and textile mills.
    A canal system connecting workshops to the docks.

19. The Undercity (Updated Overview)

More than just a labyrinth of forgotten tunnels, the Undercity is a place where remnants of the city’s dark history linger. Long ago, Visas was built over older settlements, and the Undercity holds their remnants. Hidden vaults, catacombs, and even the occasional buried temple lie beneath the surface. In recent years, scavengers, cultists, and desperate souls have sought refuge here, creating a shadow society in the depths.

Key Features:

    Hidden entrances scattered across the city.
    “The Pit Market,” a black market accessible through the Undercity.
    Stories of cursed treasures and creatures lurking in the dark.
