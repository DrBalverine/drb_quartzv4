# Title: Xameer: The Jungle of Wyrms

The vast terra incognita to the south west if the Elderwood mainland. Hot and humid, the small coastal area that has been explored indicates the continent is a great rainforest with speculated savannah further inland.

High volcanic mountains can be seen from the shoreline and deadly ravines plunge deep into the dark stone ground.
