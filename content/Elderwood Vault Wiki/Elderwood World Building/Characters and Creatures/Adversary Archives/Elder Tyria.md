Elder of Tribe Tyria 
Leader of the Outcast [[Lepidoptera]]

 
The great Balance, the great LIE. We herald the unification of the planes, the lepidoptra can be free of our eternal duty when all is one in the Aboleth's design
Find peace in the death of balance, resist and be erased.
Tell Actias we have found what we theorised so long ago, the empyrean ichor. Our Queen will rise as the Empress falls.
