Long before Creation brought forth the Gods and Dark Ones, first the prime beasts were born. Leviathans who roamed the primal stars before the planes had coalesced. They endured for eons, seeing pantheons rise and fall. After The Elder Cataclysm the Gods remade the planes. After their war they were weak and fearful that the carrion leviathans would consume them for good. So they locked them away, bound them into the furthest reaches of creation, never to scourge the planes again. The Edicts of Menelag are not just the armistice preventing the Gods from manifesting and reigniting the war. They are also the thin membrane that keeps those cunning poisonous beasts at bay. In a way creating a new plane, a nothing space keeping the old ones from mortals home. This nothing space, this barrier requires sustenance of its own, a constant stream of individual souls, a concept the Aboleth cannot abide. In this place souls would undergo judgement before their eternal reward or punishment. Purgatory.
