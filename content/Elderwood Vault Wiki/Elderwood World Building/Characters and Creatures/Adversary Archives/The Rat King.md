Down the drain where the dark water flows,  
The fiefdom of filth where nobody goes,  
Lives a big rat who rules everything—  
Shhh! Do not wake the loathsome Ratking!

He’s got teeth like pins and tails like rope,  
He stalks through the pipes hating all light and hope.  
If you sneak in for fun for a dare or a bet,  
You might not come back, your fate it is set.

So stay on the street where it's sunny and bright,  
and don't lift the grate in the middle of night.  
For if you go down where the wet shadows cling,  
Soon you'll _belong_ to the loathsome Ratking.
