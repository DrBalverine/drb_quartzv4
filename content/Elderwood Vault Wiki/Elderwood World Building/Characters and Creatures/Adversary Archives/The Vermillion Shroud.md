The grossly powerful undisputed but absent Master of all [[Vampires of The Desiccated Isle]]

Ancient beyond memory The Vermillion Shroud has dwelled on [[The Desiccated Isle]] for long ages past and is the progenitor of the vampire race. Ensconced within his crumbling ziggurat fortress, guarded by the indomitable Blood Guard, he lurks within the source of The Great Vein which flows with the rune rich lifeblood of the Isle that sustains the vampire population and is the Isle's chief export.
