A [[Fabricants]] used in a tonal architecture teleportation test, they were split throughout all the planes and perceive time as the [[Interlopers]] do. They are transposed across the material plane and many other planes where time moves at different speeds meaning one of their images can see a possible future. Parsing so many conflicting inputs however makes their predictions not always reliable. 
Interpreting all that input and their connection to the Far Realms results in cryptic prophesies that the [[brass elves]] found too poetic for real use. A monk dojo was built around them as some believed they could access higher wisdoms.  

Full name Augur of the Solder Mind
