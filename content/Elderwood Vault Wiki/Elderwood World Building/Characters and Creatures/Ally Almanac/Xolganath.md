Xolganath is a Demon Lord of the Hells.
An angel cast down, they retain a strong sense of duty and personal somewhat twisted code of honor.
They see the original function of hell as a noble goal, the punishment of the wicked.
Their eternal lifespan has twisted their view of mortals, seeing them as brief inconsequential flicker lives.
Their righteousness garnered hate among the other demon lords (Namely Ozgranoth and She Who Swarms) and a number of others conspired to imprison Xolganath in a soul linked pendant that would bind them to the mortals they thought so beneath them and greatly diminishing their power.
In their absence ambitions ran amok leading to turmoil and chaos in the hells, just the way they like it.

Xolganths Collar passed through many hands untill it was recovered by the Magister Galvotas of The Crystal College and was a topic of great discussion. They wished to summon them for questioning without the permanent binding curse the collar demanded.

Enter [[Edna & Xolganath|Edna]] who spotted the collar whilst cleaning up the chambers after another failed attempt to commune with it.
Unaware of the collars curse they tried on the tempting jewellery and became souldbound to Xolganath.
Concerned Xolganath might finally escape Edna and Xol were tasked with finding The Cask of Night a vessel the wizards deemed suitable to contain Xolganath and therefore safely break the link and save Edna.

Through their adventures it becomes clear that the soul link's influence goes both ways and now "cursed" with mortality Xolganath begins to become more receptive to new ideas.

There is a clear connection between Xolganath and Amagius, another demon the party met on their travels to the Aer Plane.
Amagius seemed to have designs that involved Xolganath and so aided the party.

It became apparent Xolganath was under more constraints than the collar alone. When freeing Aequita from The Voidborns clutches in the Aer Plane, Xolganath was forcibly discorporeated whenever in proximity.

Following Ednas death at the claws of a Xolganath doppleganger, the real Xolganath diminished much of their reserved power to bind Ednas soul further together and stop them from passing into the spirit realm.
It was not enough alone and another mysterious benefactor lent their power, long enough to persuade the Grey Mare not to collect Ednas soul this time.

> Xolganath was previously the angel of retribution for Ligatha and consort to the goddess of justice. 
> They used their privileged position to create Aequita, a child of sorts created of their and ligaths combined power.
> This creation, though out of love broke treaties set with the other gods in regards to creating more angels. As such Ligatha was furious.
