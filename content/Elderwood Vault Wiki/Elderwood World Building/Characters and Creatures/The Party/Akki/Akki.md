Akki is a Lepidopteran bard from Alcazar Actias. 
They are daughter to [[Elder Actias]] and Sister to [[Atlas]] and [[Sister Rasa]].
Being a free spirit they refused to conform to the strict orderly path prescribed to them in Lepidopteran society. They resented Elder Actias for their strict idolisation of this rigid path and in turn Actias grew more disappointed in their destined successor.
Being close to impossible to teach, [[Elder Actias]] persuaded by [[Elder Tyria]] sent Acti on their Pilgrimage early. 
When they come of age, Lepidoptera who are destined for leadership roles are sent to walk the planes, to see first hand why maintaining the great balance is so important and to return with items or knowledge that will better their kind. 
Acti jumped at the chance to leave, despite the guilt of leaving their family behind.
