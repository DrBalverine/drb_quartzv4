  

To Whomsoever May Attend,

Be it known far and wide, by the quill and scroll of my hand, that I, Magister Galvotas, a venerable Magister ensconced within hallowed halls of the illustrious Crystal College, do hereby proffer a missive of great import, bespeaking the mystical compacts and enigmatic bonds that intertwine the fates of a most humble denizen, Edna, and the otherworldly entity, the demon Xolganath.

Within the nebulous confines of this epistle, let it be inscribed that the machinations of the said demon, Xolganath, are inextricably linked to the will and stewardship of the aforesaid Edna. Know ye, then, that the fiend harbors no instinctual menace to populace nor precinct, unless explicitly instructed by the desires of Edna herself. The marauding steps taken by the demon shall be considered akin to the whisperings of her heart.

Yet, to the great consternation of the cosmos, a sobering truth must be unveiled. The essence of life that entwines Edna and Xolganath is a tapestry woven by ancient hands, such that the annihilation of the demon's corporeal existence shall inevitably cleave the mortal thread of Edna's own life. It is not a trifling matter, but a grievous breach of mystical equilibrium. To smite Xolganath is to perpetrate an unsanctioned execution, a felonious extinguishment of a spirit tethered to the Crystal College's storied lineage.

With utmost fervor, I implore each soul who encounters this parchment to apprehend the tenuous harmony that dances betwixt Edna and Xolganath. Let each stride be marked with a gentle tread, every deliberation, mindful of the intricate interplay they orchestrate. The hallowed traditions of the Crystal College compel us to shield this bond, requiring that any engagement, be it word or deed, exudes the utmost reverence and sagacity.

May the luminous wisdom of bygone epochs illuminate your deliberations and deeds.

Yours in the Arcane Order,

To Whomsoever May Attend,

I, Magister Galvotas of the Crystal College, inscribe this missive to unveil the enigmatic bond intertwining the fates of Edna, bearer of this letter, and the demon Xolganath.

It is of paramount import to understand; The demon acts solely under Edna's will, harboring no inherent threat unless guided by her intent. It is with Edna that accountability for the actions of Xolganath fall.

Know that through thaumic entanglement the life threads of Edna and Xolganath are inextricably tied and to extinguish the demon is to end Edna's life. Such an act is considered a grave transgression against The Crystal College and could release the infernal beast.

I beseech all who encounter them to grasp the delicate harmony between Edna and Xolganath. Heed this edict and treat the matter with sagacity. May ancient wisdom guide your actions.

Yours in the Arcane Order,  
  
Magister Galvotas
