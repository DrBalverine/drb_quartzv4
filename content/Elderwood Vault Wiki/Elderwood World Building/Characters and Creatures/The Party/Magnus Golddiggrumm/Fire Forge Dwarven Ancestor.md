Hrounvalla Aldroth 
Literal translation She-Smith Fire-Blood

Explored [[the Deep Canals]], Prospected deep within the [[Emberlights]] untill they slipped and fell into the elemental plane of fire.
There they roved searching for a way home. During which time they fought the fire giant demigod [[Vhertog]]. Their flame burned bright but brief as they were betrayed by [[Surtr]] who usurped the throne and exiled Hrounvalla.
She returned to the Dwarven fiefdoms with the ability to command fire elementals to fuel their forges to before unreachable intensity. 

Sutr had plans to burn the material plane
With her new forges and the aid of a genasi druid [[Hrounvalla]] forged weapons and chains of blue fire and steel to subdue Surtr. She took from the fire tyrant his beating heart which still sits in the grand cavern of [[Kher Muldur]] as their Sun under the Stone.
The defeated Surtr lived but is forever bound in the fire plane never to rule again.

All this is recounted in a 12 act, week long [[Dwarven]] opera known as the Igni Saga.
