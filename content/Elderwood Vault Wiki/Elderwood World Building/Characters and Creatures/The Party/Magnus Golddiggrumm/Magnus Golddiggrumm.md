-My dwarf fella is the dwarf equivalent of 35ish in dwarf years.

-He 'weaves' magic through understanding. Think any medical drama where a character visualises medical knowledge in real time.

-He has been to the same university as both (Attended The Crystal College: School of Thaumic Artifice). Would have known Edna as a Tea-lady/member of staff, well connected. Would have interected with Cornelius Moonwing for acquisition of magical artifacts or rare components, therefore gained acquaintance with Akki. 
Wizards of the college that you knew had interactions with Moonwing spoke often but circumspectly about the possibilities that a Lepidoptra presents and uses for their potent Elemental energies. 

-Being the eternal 'PhD'/'PostDoc for a very very long time.
Studied magical artifcats, did a post-doc on soul coins/ semi-sentient 

^^Lets broaden this a little and incorporate your dwarf's skills, how about they studied thaumic energies and their containment. Including the power contained in soul coins and arcane or divine artifacts, different methods for containment and extraction.

-First job that hires him and offers him some good money and opportunities was the fabricant creation programme. Did research for them, studying how it went, trying to replicate the process without all the costly electrum, but replicating electrum on the cheap was incredibly difficult. This seemed a bit dodgy, but was intimidated into continuing by scary bad guys.

^^^ On the back of the above how about their research caught the eye of one Magister Calvus who directed them to the neo-fabricant research programme. 
Suspicious were raised when you were made to wear a blindfold on the journey to the facility and were not allowed to leave/see outside.
The [[Brass elves]] there looked sick and were cagey about the neo-fabricant creation process but they did let enough slip for you to know electrum is necessary and it's usual source. Also that tremendous energies were required for something called The Immix Flux.
Calvus encouraged the pursuit of pseudo-electrum and provided a number of soul coins, arcane gems etc for your attempts to infuse inert alloys. This would obviously make one of good morals a bit uncomfortable and  with but it didnt work and they became increasingly angry and begun suggesting necromancy as a potential solution. They also used your weave knowledge to develop the Aetheric Leechstones, used to draw in and store magic.


-'Worships'/Acknowledges many of the dwarven pantheon. The good ones (or at least neutral).
Especially God of Knowledge. This god has always been a source of divine inspiration, his 'muse'.
Clings to a more local mining/metals god as a trace to home.


^^Love the household god flavour thats brilliant.
Praementum is the Numina god of Inspiration, Craft and Sorcery. They are the one who stopped the [[Brass Elves]] from being destroyed by the rest of the gods.
It is through Praementum that the veil is parted and the weave of magic is allowed access to the world.
As well as this the dwarves revere the ground itself, believing the earth, seas, skies etc to be sleeping godlike titan elementals. They also worship their ancestors and make great deal of the past's accomplishments. It is important to dwarves that success never be forgotten and as such lorekeepers are held in high regard. We can workshop a particular potential ancestor if you like



Gods started to back off upon his recruitment,, but continued because money/equipment/opportunities  were good.  < and coercion

^^ It would makes sense that as you walked down a darker path that spark of inspiration from the gods began to get fainter.


-Tries to leave the programme, has many many regrets. They force him to stay, becomes an unwilling participants.



After having built X - very obvious bad evil thing, gods stopped whispering to him and has lost his connection to them.

^^ A by product of the leechstone, pseudo-electrum and soul coin research and unwilling participation in a very dark necromantic ritual lead to the creation of soul cages. Usually the creation of soul coins must be via a demon or devil but this discovery then taken by Calvus and another mysterious benefactor has allowed them to trap and store the souls of mortals for their own nefarious purposes.



-Somehow escapes - Party help?  
^^ This will depend on when we slot your new guy in but quite possibly, otherwise you eventually escaped on your own but have been on the run. Perhaps hearing Calvus being furious about the party lead you to seek them out.

-Is now driven to undo the evil he has helped manufacture. Very good guy. Much ethics.
^ Perfect


-Might have a Scottish accent. Or maybe American, because Dragon age did it. Who knows?

Sweet now all you need is a name and we can make sheets.
