# Title: Crimson Court

A Council of Vampire Lords who govern [[The Desiccated Isle]] in the absence of [[The Vermillion Shroud]].

Terrible Sorcerer-Kings of immense power that each rule one of the outlying city-states on [[The Desiccated Isle]] . These mighty spellcasters have held their thrones for centuries; no one alive or undead remembers a time before the sorcerer-kings. Some claim to be gods, and some claim to serve gods. Some are brutal oppressors, where others are more subtle in their tyranny. The sorcerer-kings govern through priesthoods or bureaucracies of greedy, ambitious templars, lesser vampires who can call upon the kingsï¿½ powers and vast hosts of slaves.

Each council member is the Master of their Clan and those below them. The internal bureaucracy and political maneuvering mean the balance of power between them is always in flux but balanced none the less. The leader of each respective clan is adorned with a ceremonial golden mask, a powerful magical artifact, and symbol of office/authority. Each mask appears as a resplendent golden animal head and are rumored to have existed before the sands took over the Isle.
