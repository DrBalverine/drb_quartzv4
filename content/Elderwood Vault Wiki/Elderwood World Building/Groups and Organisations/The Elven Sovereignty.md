*"Elaris Domina, Strength through Unity, Unity through Devotion, Elaris Invictus"*  


The current ruling government of Elderwood.
Under the [[Eladrin Empire]] elves were a subjugated people. Their great rebellion during the Chinobiarch's Folly allowed them to usurp their cruel masters but at great cost. The most powerful of the remaining elven clans vowed never again to be mastered by anyone and proceeded to conquer the other clans in what is now called The Unification of Elderwood.

 This kingdom was achieved due to their aptitude for drake riding and sorcery, this substantial advantage is what gave them the power to conquer and integrate the other tribes to form the organisation seen today.
 
 In recent times the sovereignty has been tested by a myriad of threats. The largest of which being The Ruin of[[The Northern Wastes]] which wiped out a large portion of their power base shifting rulership to the current monarch Padesha Empress Her Supreme Majesty Valsaketh Domina of All Elderwood 
 
 
 Curiously the sovereignty's fabled wyvern riders have been absent since the ruin and many of the subjugated cultures under the sovereignty are quietly questioning if the sovereignty is truly all powerful anymore.  

The sovereignty believes in security and stability above all things and is not above minor acts of tyranny to maintain it as stated by Grand Prefect Tsarnok: *"When diplomacy fails we are left with only one alternative, violence, the beauty of shock and awe. Force must be applied without apology. It's the Sovereignty way and it has kept our great isle in order for generations, we have moved to a new age of peace and prosperity far beyond our savage past and we will do whatever we must to maintain it"*
Tsarnok later established the Sovereignty's first Inquisitors which would eventually become [[The Sovereignty Security Bureau]].

However this has also lead to a great stagnation culturally for the sovereignty's elite who are happy for the status quo to remain the same for eternity. This has put them at direct ideological odds with the rising [[human]] population whom strive for ever increasing change in the world.
