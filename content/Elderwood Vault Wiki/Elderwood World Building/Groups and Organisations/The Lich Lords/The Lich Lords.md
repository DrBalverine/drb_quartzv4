These powerful necromancers ruled over [[The Human Reserve]] for some time, growing their dark powers at the expense of the populous. During their reign, the southern lands were plunged into an age of oppression, cruelty, and fear as eldritch horrors lurked in every shadow and common folk slaughtered in fell rituals. The Lich Lords were cunning and fearsome individually but with their powers combined they proved to be an almost insurmountable force that dominated the southern lands. Scholars, however, have noted that despite their evil deeds The Lich Lords were incredibly shrewd make the right connections and send generous tithes to [[The Elven Sovereignty]] whom in return turned a blind eye to their dark tyranny. This lasted until [[The Silver Knight Rebellion]] which brought an end to their nefarious regime.


The evil they wrought has been largely forgotten, leaving them as an old story to scare children or as the villains in a play, not the legacy which they aspired to but it is undeniable that they have made a lasting impact on the land. To this day necromancy is still illegal in [[The Human Reserve]] and civilization is only now beginning to take its first steps to reclaim the wild places cursed and defiled by The Lich Lords brutal touch.
