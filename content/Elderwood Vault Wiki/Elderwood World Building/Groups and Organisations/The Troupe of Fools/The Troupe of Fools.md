The Troupe of Fools

The troupe of Fools are a semi religious order that has sequestered itself at the highest echelons of power. Ostensibly they are personal entertainment for nobility but to those in the know they serve a important dual purpose to ensure the mental health of their master.

This does give them a very useful position with which they can subtly influence their masters decisions and collectively hold great power over events. It is rumoured by those in the know that The Fools and @The Court of Sorceresses butt heads on many issues. The more paranoid believe they play the political landscape against one another in a great game of influence.

The troupe's goals are not common knowledge and one can only hope they are benevolent.

"We are tragic,' said the Fool, 'but we laugh at our tragedy as you laugh at your own. The painted grin leers out from the darkness, mocking our insane belief in order, logic, status, the reality of reality. The mask knows that we are born on the banana skin that leads only to the open manhole cover of doom, and all we can hope for are the cheers of the crowd."

The Troupe uses theatrical hierarchy. Their current leader under the rank of Producer is [[Dr Grimkoff]] a white faced clown so careful about secrecy they communicate only through puppet shows and are always guarded by their psionic mime assassins.
