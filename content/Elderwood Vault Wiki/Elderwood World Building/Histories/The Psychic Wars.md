The conflict that ravaged [[The Human Reserve]] and some portions of [[The Elven Sovereignty]] and [[The Drakenmyre Imperium]]. 
Instigated by an ancient amethyst dragon returning from planar exploration to the farthest reaches.
Upon their return they raised armies of [[Gemstone Dragonborne]] , [[Drake Hound]] and other monstrosities to raze towns. The gemstone army roved  the land psychically enslaving the population for goals unknown.
The Amethyst Dragon was eventually defeated and being the core of the hivemind released those under their control to their own devices.
