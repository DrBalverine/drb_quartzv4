[[The Numina]]
# Title: Aasimar and Tiefling (The Children of The Gods)

Aasimar and Tielfing represent what happens when The Numina or other significantly powerful beings mix their blood with that of mortals.

Not all these bastard children are recognized by their progenitor but those that do unlock a deeper connection to their benefactor and in truth so vast is the power of these beings they can impart this connection onto others they deem worthy. Often an individual will be recognized and recruited to be an agent of their progenitor to further their plots and goals on the material plane, this inevitably puts Tiefling and Aasimar of opposing progenitors into conflict.
