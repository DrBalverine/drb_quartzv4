# Title: City Elves

[img:136237]

The underclass of [[The Elven Sovereignty]] made up of the portion of the Elven population that are not of the noble [[High Elves]] breed.

These city elves have against the wishes of the sedintary noble class and the nature obsessed [[Wyld Elves]], embraced the younger races of the world and the more metropolitan life introduced by (for the most part) the expanding [[Human]] race.
