# Title: Dragonborne

Incredibly rare, the gemstone Dragonborne are the result of powerful rituals, the vestiges of @[[The Psychic Wars]] (military conflict) made as avatars for their psionic dragon masters. Now, these waifs are cut loose from the ties that bound them to their creators and are free to choose their own path. Most are naive to the ways of the world having been born fully grown, made to be inhabited by minds so inscrutable the clumsy common tongue cannot adequately describe. Some find their own path in a world that sees them as a defeated enemy that caused untold atrocities while others search for their lost masters or prepare for their return. 

It has been hypothesised that Dragonborne who owe their parentage to chromatic or metallic dragons could exist and report of a handful of individuals have been reported over the years along the southern coast. These reports, however, are scattered and lacking credibility.
