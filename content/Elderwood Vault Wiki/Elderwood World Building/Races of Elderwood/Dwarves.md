# Title: Dwarves

[i]Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone.


Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home.


Skin made of iron, steel in our bones.


We do not fear what lies beneath.


We can never dig too deep[/i]


- Song from Dwarven folklore, unknown writer


[[Lucrumis-Aurur]] as is his nature bought the dwarves from [[Kepheros]] who claimed them after their accidental creation. They were Titanspawn when the world was created the gods made a deal with the Titans in exchange for great arcane powers the Titans would be the shapers of the world, carving out islands, continents, mountains, and valleys at the Numina's direction.

However, the Numina were cunning the great powers they gave the Titans proved too much to for their minds to handle all at once and they fell into a deep sleep never to wake until their minds could recover and they would rise once more as gods.

Eons later the primeval elves discovered a sleeping Titan now more similar to a mountain range than a being. Within they found veins of a potent substance that enhanced their arcane powers exponentially. In their greed for this power, they devised a way to kill the Titan and claim it's powerful ore. In attempting this act of divine murder the first dwarves appeared. Born from the rock of the Titan itself these dwarves, scholars believe, were formed unconsciously by the titan as a means of defense. However, the primeval elves succeeded and slew the titan in its eternal sleep greedily they took what scraps of power remained for their own purposes.

Although the murder it seems was not absolute as dwarves continued to appear until there were enough to support a burgeoning civilization. Then once more the Titan lie dormant and has been until the present day leading some to consider it finally dead and a vast majority having forgotten its existence entirely. 

[[Kepheros]] took this new species under his wing, teaching them the value of the rock and earth that had spawned them. They soon excelled in not only acquiring but refining and crafting with the bounty of the mountains, their heritage.

This drew the eye of [[Lucrumis-Aurur]] who offered [[Kepheros]] a deal in exchange for them.

 The price paid was to craft for [[Kepheros]] an exquisite runed spearhead forged from the star metal Aethrium that [[Kepheros]] would use to fight back [[Taefana]] stopping her from afflicting his grove and creating evergreen trees that never decay as they were beyond the withering touch of [[Taefana]]. [[Lucrumis-Aurur]] saw [[Kepheros]] busy with the forest and encouraged the dwarves to exploit the earth further and uncover the riches he had hidden within, culminating in the dwarven culture present today. 

But their origins can still be seen in their reverence for the stone they call home and their preference for the mountain caverns that bore them into this world.
