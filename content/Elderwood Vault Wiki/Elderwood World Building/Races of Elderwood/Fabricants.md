Golems have existed in Elderwood since the first animancers imbued false life into mundane objects of clay, wax or wood. Since the re-emergence of the [[Brass Elves]] these mindless machines have advanced by leaps and bounds culminating in The Gilded Legion which is still one of the mightiest military forces on the isles (though their unique origin and technomancy/construction is unknown). Now the push for innovation especially with the masterly work of the [[Brass Elves]] arcane craftsmen has created sophisticated  automata that are capable of advanced independent thought, constructed imitation of life. [[The Elven Sovereignty]] has outlawed any further advancement into Fabricant Beings (the term given to the theoretical automata with its own consciousness and soul) but even now in secret, some animacers experiment with the process of infusing the inanimate with souls.


Anatomy
The core of a fabricant is a skeletal frame made of metal with special tensile alloy filaments acting as a muscular system. The core is covered in metal plates to protect the internals including a network of tubes that run through the fabricant's body, these tubes are filled with a white blood-like fluid that is designed to lubricate and nourish their systems. Their appendages like most of their anatomy is dependent on their original construction but it is not unknown for a fabricant to have specialized modular appendages to make it more suited for its purpose.   The fabricants face loosely resembles their [[Brass Elves|Brass Elf]] creators though they have a toothless jaw, heavy brow line and are lacking noses and hair. Each fabricant has a makers mark engraved upon them. Each of these runes is unique to the fabricants giving them a sense of individuality. Fabricants are able to be repaired and modified by artificers or even themselves giving them an endless possibility to their appearances.

Genetics and Reproduction
While an individual fabricant may possess a any personality, their form is dependent on their construction.

Dietary Needs and Habits
Fabricants do not need to eat or breathe but can ingest food and drink if you wish. Instead of sleeping, they will enter an inactive "recharge" state for 4 hours each day and remain fully aware of their surroundings during this time.

Biological Cycle
Being constructs fabricants theoretically can live for eternity as long as they receive regular maintenance and repairs.

Genetic Ancestor(s)
