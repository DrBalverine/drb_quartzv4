# Title: Genasi

Genasi are elemental humanoids born of nature itself. They are manifestations of the element of their origin much like true elementals but incarnate in humanoid bodies when nature requires a voice to make its feelings known.

They are inexorably tied to the balance of earth air fire and water these beings are born with purpose, though they may not know it, to maintain this world in nature's eternal war against corruption and entropy. Though some attribute these beings as agents of [[Kepheros]] due to his lordship over nature this has never been fully confirmed but it is not uncommon to see Genasi in places of interest to the wild king.

Elementaris Inkarni

## Anatomy

Primarily humanoid is form, Genasi possess unique defining characteristics depending on their element of origin.

This can manifest in a plethora of ways such as coloured skin, stone scales, profuse dripping or flaming hair.

## Genetics

Genasi are born of nature itself, essentially being more personable elementals. They can be thought of as nature's immune system, arising in the world when nature perceives a great threat on the horizon. As such, they are not born in the conventional manner more seeded within the world and then found. This can occur in a number of ways, such as a Genasi baby being discovered within a geode underground, rising as an adult from a geyser or blinking into existence at the striking point of a lightning bolt.

While Genasi possess the ability to reproduce it is so rare as to have little to no documentation.

## Diet

Genasi require rest the same as most humanoids however their food is unique as they often consume items related to their element of origin. A fire Genasi may in a pinch consume fuel sources, flame itself or just have a strong preference towards hot foods for example.
