# Title: Gnoll

Gnolls are nomadic dog men who rove the coastline of [[The Desiccated Isle]]. Using the barren shores as a staging grounds for their prolific piracy of trading ships along the salt aegis sea. It is the sign of a wealthy gnoll captain if it still retains its original teeth as scurvy is rife among their crews, mostly subsiding on the flesh of their enemies and little in the way of balanced nutrition.

Being native to the isles inevitably some gnoll have been recruited by the dominant vampire population, some even fortunate enough to receive their dark gift. A peculiar metamorphosis occurs with gnolls turned vampiric, taking on a jakal form and a unique navy black coat, this change is so far unexplained but among the isles it is believed that it is the will of [[The Vermillion Shroud]] spread through the blood.
