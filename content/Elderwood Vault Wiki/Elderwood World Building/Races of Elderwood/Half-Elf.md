# Title: Half-Elf

Considered by [[High Elves]] to be the lowest form of elf. A point past which their elven blood is so diluted as to be indistinguishable from the mundane existence of humanity. 
Half elves struggle to find a home in either eleven or [[human]] society, each group seeing half elves as a member of the opposite group.
