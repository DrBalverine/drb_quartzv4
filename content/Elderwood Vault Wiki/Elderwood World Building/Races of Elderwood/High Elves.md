# Title: High Elves

The race that makes up the ruling elite of [[The Elven Sovereignty]].

"High" is often understood to mean proud or snobbish, and these nobles generally personify these characteristics, for which the "lesser races" generally resent them. High Elves live between three and five times as long as [[Human|Humans]] and where they fall inevitably a spirit tree will rise, a conduit for later generations to commune with their ancestors. High Elves consider themselves to be the most civilized culture of Elderwood; the common tongue of the continent is a deep devolution of high elven speech and writing, and most of [[The Elven Sovereignty]]'s arts, crafts, laws, and sciences are derived from High Elven traditions.

The High Elves are the most strongly gifted in the arcane arts of all the races. They are among the longest living and most intelligent races of Elderwood, and they often become powerful magic users due to both their magical affinity and the many years they may devote to their studies.
