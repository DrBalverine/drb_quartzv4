# Title: Hobgoblin

The gross joining of humanoid and beast through profane magics has produced the blight upon civilisation known as the hobgoblin. Smart as the civilised races turned to dark purpose by the cruelty and savagery of their goblin heritage.

Organised and merciless these beasts are behind much that puts fear into the hearts of the common folk, easy prey for the raiding tribes who stalk the edges of the great forests and mountains.
