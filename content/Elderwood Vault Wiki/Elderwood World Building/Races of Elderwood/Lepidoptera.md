The Lepidoptra, an insect like folk, are as mysterious and strange as their origins suggest. They are nomads, travellers and guardians of the Elemental plane of air, but as is custom adolescents make a pilgrimadge tour of the material plane or fae wilds with a fierce curiosity for all cultures and races    

**Dapper, Dedicated and Smart**

Standard lepidoptra look like moths or butterflies, with large wings anchored to their back and long feathered antennae. Similar to moths they have a coat of soft downy fur or hair and a thick mane of fur around their neck and head. They have insect like appendages and sometimes compound eyes. What type of moth or buttlerfly they take after is highly variable, some appearing like common styes and others like large Atlas moths or Queen Alexandra Birdwings. They have a tendency to wear elaborate silk or finely woven garments, with different family and social groups placing more importance on the sheerness or texture of the woven garments. Richer and more influential lepidoptra will often wear brightly coloured garments decorated with beads and sequins. It is for this reason that shiny but simple jewellery that makes sound as it moves is favoured by the lepidoptra, who often choose to match their outfits to the appearance of their wings    

**Circadian Species**

The work to maintain and protect the Elemental plane is a constant process. As such different clans work throughout the day and night. As such they have adapted to their environment. The more moth-like lepidoptra are almost entirely a nocturnal. They have limited daytime vision, though this can be corrected with glasses or lenses. However, they have fantastic dark vision, using smell to “see”. They prize perfume and enjoy making it themselves. During the night they will usually be constantly on the wing, tirelessly flying as they travel from place to place. This movement makes them excellent merchants, couriers and mercenaries as their swift movement means things get done faster. However they can be easily distracted, especially by bright lights which confuses their navigation.    

**Social Structure**

Lepidoptra often live among family groups but are know to work solitarily when required to maintain the Great Balance of the Planes. When they tour the other planes they will attempt to form bonds with others they meet, preffering to make a family away from family. When accepted they have known to assist in great works akin to their floating cities back home. These floating cities are filled with light, colour, music and delicate scents, making them a sight to behold. When they come of age some Lepidoptra choose to wander the other planes alone seeking something of great value to return with and to explore and expand their horizons. These Lepidoptra tend to wear the clothes of the other ground locked species and sometimes wear their shoes to save their feet as they walk.  

**Mannerisms and names**

The otherworldly race tends to exhibit bug like mannerisms, with strange and jerky movements. Though they will talk and chitter to one another they will also speak via movement and in some cases pheromones. Thus, outsiders often find it difficult to learn Lepidopti despite it's similarities to Primordial. Lepidoptra will learn outside languages, favouring languages adapted to tusks or fangs like Orcish so that they can accommodate their mandibles.
