# Title: Orc

The green skinned tusked orc are very familiar with hardship, living in nomadic steppe clans on the plains of the northern most tip of the mainland. Tribal through tradition rather than lack of advancement the orc clans are a strong , resilient people. Utilitarian, brusk and further hardened by the ruin of the north and loss of their ancestral homelands they are one of the many people's displaced by that disaster. 
Only a small handful of tribes were able to escape The Ruin. The vast majority of the orc people are now chattle for The Northern Waste's demon lords where they act as slave labour and soldiers (The Great Gate stopping most demonic incursion but not their converted followers)

Bitter and feeling betrayed, some willingly joined with the hellish host as means of getting revenge against those who thye feel abandoned them.

Those few that did escape are now indebted to [[The Elven Sovereignty]] (organisation), after @The Exodus (article), Orcish tribes are having some form of elven society thrust upon them as they work to repay their benevolent overlords. The orc found many strange and unique materials in their travels and mastered the lost arts of forging with them, it is said masterwork Orcish armour will outlive it's maker a hundred times over.

However many among their people have chosen to take their recent hardships as a sign from the gods to return to the old ways. Now bands of raiders rove the land bringing terror and cruelty to the populus in the name of their old ways and dark gods.
