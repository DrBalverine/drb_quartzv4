# Title: Vampires of The Desiccated Isle

The Vampires have "conquered" the limitations of the curse. The upper class of vampires may now freely move in daylight by painting themselves in gold, which deflects its deadly light. As such, they have substantial trade with the dwarves who mine it. 

With their unlimited source of blood, they have greatly advanced blood magic and as a result, become resistant to its corruption.

Vampires do not turn to dust instantly if they are hit by sunlight, but they initially become very weak, especially susceptible to all damage. In time they will decay, rotting quickly and their flesh peels from their bones and they will end up losing their minds if they are in that skeletal state for too long. However, the touch of blood can begin to restore them.

Vampiric immortality leads many to a life of hedonism and decadence as their thirst for distraction is almost equal to their thirst for blood.

# Extras


## Trinominal

Exanima Haemodevorus Noctus

## Ancenstry

The Vermilion Shroud, the ancient elusive progenitor and master of all vampires.

## Anatomy

Some morphology depends on the individual vampire's original species, however, they do have some unifying traits

## Perception

**Darkvision**

Thanks to your heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You canï¿½t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Vampires also have a nebulous blood scent they can use to sense prey.

## Genetics

New vampires are created by a higher vampire draining the supplicant of all blood, turning them into a Vampire Spawn that is slave to their sire. If the sire allows the vampire spawn to feed on their more potent blood the spawn is elevated to the lowest tier of vampire but fully fledged none the less

## Diet

A vampire must spend 3 gold pieces times half their level (rounded up) per day to protect themselves from the sun by crushing and dusting themselves with a paste made from gold and their own blood. If they do not do this the vampire gains vulnerability to all forms of damage while in daylight.

A vampire must also feed on 3 liters of blood every 3 days or suffer vulnerability to all forms of damage until they feed again.

## Growthrate

There is a strict hierarchy structure on the desiccated isle which mirrors the different stages of a vampires life/development. Citizens are grouped into (from highest to lowest) Lords (the ruling elite, the wealthy, the powerful), Thralls (Those who serve the lords in more advanced positions, warriors, traders, researchers musicians, most non-menial work) or Slaves (The lowly and owned portion of society. These chattels are disposable and insignificant). While this caste system is strict, ambition is often smiled upon if the individual is deserving. It is not uncommon for individuals to move up or down this system through great feats, great failure or sabotage.
