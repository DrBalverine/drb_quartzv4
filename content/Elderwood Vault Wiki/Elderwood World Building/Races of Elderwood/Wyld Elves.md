![[Wyld Elves.png]]

Within the forest of ancestors, an ancient sect of elves survives in those deadly glades. A secretive people, the Aborakin, or best know as the Wyld Elves to the rest of the world, staunchly but furtively protect the woods they call home. Their druidic culture is greatly driven by spiritual practices, guided by their mystics known for their use of primal energies in their magicks. Unlike the men and women of Elderwood, they find little value in gold and jewels preferring a communal society where all in the tribe do their part to make the whole better. In this manner, they have lived within the forest of ancestors for thousands of years, a growing movement within the trees, nature's fierce guardians.   Previously [[Wyld Elves]] were ostracised by [[The Elven Sovereignty]] but have relatively recently been reaccepted into the fold. This shift is likely due to the Ruin of the northern realms and the discovery of the [[High Elves]] "Dilution". [[The Elven Sovereignty]] now seeks new elven allies in the face of the waxing influence of the [[Human]]ity
