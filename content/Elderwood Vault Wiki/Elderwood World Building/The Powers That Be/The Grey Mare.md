### The Grey Mare: Goddess of the Cycle

The Grey Mare is a Being of Power on par with [[The Numina]], governing the endless cycle of **birth, death, and rebirth**. Represented as a spectral, skeletal horse draped in a white shroud and garland, The Grey Mare’s mythos intertwines the solemnity of death with the hope of renewal.

#### **Domains and Symbolism**

- **Death and Rebirth**: The Grey Mare embodies the paradox of death as both an end and a beginning, guiding souls through the transition to new cycles of existence.
- **Psychopomp**: She escorts the souls of the dead, presenting them to the gods for judgment and ensuring their proper placement in the afterlife.
- **Cycle Keeper**: A fierce protector of the natural order, she opposes anything that disrupts the cycle, such as necromancy or unnatural immortality.
- **Seasonal Association**: Linked to the end of winter and the coming of spring, symbolising renewal after hardship.

#### **Mythological Role**

1. **Arbiter of Souls**: Upon death, The Grey Mare collects souls and presents them to the gods, who must argue their claims over them. She serves as the final judge, determining the soul’s destination based on deals, devotion, and tenets. The chosen god’s realm prepares the soul for eventual rebirth.
2. **Opposition to Necromancy**: The Grey Mare strongly opposes necromancy as it disrupts the natural cycle. She reclaims souls bound by necromancers, curses those who defy her, and sends visions warning of necromancy’s dangers. However, she might tolerate respectful ancestral veneration or reluctant use of necromancy to restore balance.
3. **Festival of Transition**: A festival in her honor involves offerings, feasting, and a **dusk-till-dawn party**, symbolising both placating The Grey Mare (forestalling death) and securing good fortune for the next cycle.
