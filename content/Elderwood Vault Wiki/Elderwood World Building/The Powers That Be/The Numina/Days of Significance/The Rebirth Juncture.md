[[Nithra]]
# Title: The Rebirth Juncture

The Rebirth Juncture is the yearly event where the fates and destinies of mortals are yet to be decided. The world is plunged into persistent twilight with the uncertainty as [[Nithra]] and [[Xarphios]] judge mortals and write their stories. People give offerings, make oaths, pledges or sacrifices to [[Nithra]] in the hope of steering the course of their lives to a more favourable outcome.

A select few will be chosen to meet with the Numen Lords in person and discuss their potential.
