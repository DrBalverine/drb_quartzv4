[[Ligatha]]

# Title: The Righteous Sacrament

_Observed annually on the longest day of summer, symbolising the enduring light of justice._

### Common Rites and Veneration

- **The Chains of Oath:**  
    At dawn, citizens and pilgrims gather in town squares or temple courtyards. Participants clasp silver chains or braided cords, forming circles, while swearing personal oaths aloud. These range from public declarations of innocence to vows to right specific wrongs. Breaking an oath sworn on this day is considered both a crime and a spiritual curse.
    
- **The Tribunal Masque:**  
    In major cities, a grand theatrical trial is staged—half morality play, half legal spectacle. Historical injustices, famous betrayals, or allegorical crimes are re-enacted with masked performers. A real audience jury deliberates the verdict, reminding all that justice is a living, communal responsibility.
    
- **Vigil of the Unburdened:**  
    From sunset to midnight, confession booths, temple alcoves, and even traveling priests offer private absolution for those who carry unspoken guilt or burdens. Though Ligatha despises deceit, she allows this one day for souls to unburden themselves anonymously—on the condition they make restitution within the year.

### Unique Divine Demands and Miraculous Events

- **The Judgment of Shadows:**  
    It is whispered (flatly, by those with experience) that Ligatha occasionally manifests through animate shadows during the festivities. These shadows approach the truly guilty—those who have evaded mortal justice. They whisper accusations, reveal hidden evidence, or, in dire cases, physically restrain the wicked until proper authorities arrive.
    
- **Trial by Light:**  
    Select temples host literal trials for unresolved crimes or disputed grievances. A relic known as _Ligatha’s Prism_ is used—those who pass through its refraction appear illuminated if truthful, darkened if deceitful. It's deeply unreliable for trivial matters but terrifyingly accurate when guilt stains the soul.
    
- **The Scales' Silence:**  
    For one hour at midday, it is customary for cities to fall silent—markets close, voices hush—as all reflect on injustices unpunished. During this silence, it's said Ligatha listens most keenly. Some claim petitions made during this hour have been granted as dreams, visions, or cryptic verdicts scrawled in ash or wax.

**Additional Oddities**

- Priests of Ligatha often carry portable ledgers or "Books of Redress"—citizens can record grievances, injustices, or disputes to be reviewed by the temple later. These books see heavy use on the holy day, with long queues and many passive-aggressive entries.
    
- It is considered unlucky to lie, even jokingly, on The Righteous Sacrament. Superstition suggests Ligatha herself may brand false tongues with silver scars that fade only when the truth is spoken.
