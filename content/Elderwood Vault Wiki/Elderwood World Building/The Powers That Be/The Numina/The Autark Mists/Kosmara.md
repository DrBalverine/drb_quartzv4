The Mother Oracle, The Dreamstrider and The Torpor Phantasm. Kosmara is one of the older and wiser of the Numina. Where Tsori-Praementum the master of innovation governs arcane magics, Kosmara governs hedge magic, illusion and the power that can be drawn from oneiromancy. Kosmara's worshippers often beseech her for prophetic dreams or to curse their enemies with nightmares made manifest. Master of the Occult she values the imagination of mortals and persecutes the ignorant.
