## Overview
While most Numen Lords are insular, in their own way, seeing themselves as separate or above all other beings, this is most certainly not the case for Bit-Harai. It is, therefore, a surprise to no one that the god of revelry takes some personal interest ( and in many cases involvement) in mortal lives, causing light-hearted mischief and the hijinks that ensue when beings become released from their inhibitions.
