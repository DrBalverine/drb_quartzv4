The pantheon of divine entities present in Elderwood. The Numina each hold dominion over their own plane beyond that of the material one in which Elderwood resides. The plane of each god is a reflection and extension of its lord even the material plane.   The constant struggle for control over the material plane and the reverence or subjugation of its mortals and their souls holds much of the Numinas' attention but being evenly matched no one lord can get ahead without the others rallying against them and any alliance is temporary at best as each god ultimately sees itself as superior.   [[The Numina]] can be divided into three groups depending on their involvement in and intentions for the material plane. These groups are [[The House of Woes]], [[The Radiant Accord]] and [[The Autark Mists]] unaligned neutral gods, who's goals are unknown.   The Numina were (according to themselves for there are few who would argue) responsible for the creation of the planes after The Cataclysm, the war in the heavens that tore existence asunder. These survivors, rebels, victors, brought about the creation of all the known universe and now rule over their domain harvesting the souls of the faithful, for some ineffable purpose.
