[[Gods]] [[Numina]] 

## Overview
The Huntsman, Sherpherd of the Wilds and Father of Beasts. Kepheros governs the natural cycles of the world having a hand in the seasons and growth of life. His work is undermined or assisted (depending on your point of view) by Taefana who's decay ensures balance. But his nurturing role is not all kindness as it is their belief that threat is the harbinger of development. A tree in the harshest wind growth the toughest trunk. As such Kepheros embodies the hunt, to them and their followers the struggle to survive impoves a life and brings them closer to their potential. Kepheros advocates sportsmanship in his dealings. It is unbecoming of a hunter to cheat their prey of a fair chance. A prey that can overcome their pursuer whatever their form, no matter the odds is to be admired and rewarded.
