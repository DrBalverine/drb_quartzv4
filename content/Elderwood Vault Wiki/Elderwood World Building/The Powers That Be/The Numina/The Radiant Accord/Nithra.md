[[Gods]] [[Numina]] 

## Overview
Nithra is one of the more merciful and benevolent Numen Lords presiding over Elderwood. It is her will that subtly influences the chains of destiny that inexorably pull all to their purpose. As such she exists in a state of transition, in those hours "where greatness is realized". It is said that every event has at some point felt her guiding touch and at momentous occasions is known to make a discreet appearance if one is observant and know what to look for.
