## Overview

*"Come to me, Praementum, for without you, my wit is weak to sort the wheat from the chaff, and my eyes should neither know the true from the false, nor sense from folly, nor justice from prejudice and interest. Grant me mindfulness that I may know the truth. In my need I seek wisdom from the wise."*  - Litany to The Spark  
Tsori-Praementum (Tsori is believed to be a title in a long forgotten language meaning both King, Elder and wisest of the wise) All father of knowledge and magic.

Praementum is said to be the father of inspiration, quite literally. It is said Loucura and Harai decided to make fun Praementum who's studious nature irked them. 
They "poisoned wit with courage" in an effort to make Praementum lose their cold fa√ßade and admit affection for the art and beauty of Kohannya. In turn they "drowned the demure of love" in Kohannya whom too held a secret affection for Praementum's wonders. Their trap set the two trickster gods led the two to a secret glade and allowed their thoughts to meld uninhibited.

The plan succeeded and the fruit of this union became the Inspirations: Sapentia, Loquella and Peritia.
