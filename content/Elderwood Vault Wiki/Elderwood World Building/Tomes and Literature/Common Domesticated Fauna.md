# Title: Common Domesticated Fauna

Musk-ox (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskox,) according to some the most useful animal on Elderwood. Easily domesticated, a milk meat and fur/wool factory, will graze on pretty much anything even lichen and an excellent beast of burden. On the back of Musk-ox civilizations rise.

White Hart (Dragon age Halla http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Halla) Given their long lifespan some of the elves have taken it upon themselves Sto domesticate the the great elk of the woods. The elven equivalent to horses but much more adept at navigating the vast tangled forests.

Horses rarer than one might expect but not drastically so. The north had plenty before the ruin, running in large wild herds. Now southern coasts are the primary source of horses, good for if you need something done light and fast otherwise get a Musk-ox.

Hounds (Basically all of the more robust working dog breeds. Wolfhounds yes, grey hounds no. Bloodhounds yes, basset hounds no. None of the more modern breeds exist, a hound is an extra mouth to feed and therefore needs to be useful to be worth keeping. You get the idea.
