# Title: StarMetal

Starmetal is impossibly rare material considered mythical by most. Starmetal is pure unfettered creation waiting for will to be imposed upon it, yearning for form and purpose. Its power is immeasurable with the potential to warp all reality by the user's design or be formed into a tool or weapon of world-shaping power.

# Extras


## Characteristics

A very bright white/cyan core licked with arcane violet flame. It is both icy cold like the void and hotter than the heart of a star to touch. When struck with force it is an immovable object yet when approached delicately could even be poured. It's properties defy reason it being created before such notions were imposed on the universe.

## Origin

Starmetal is found in the core of fallen celestial bodies beyond that its origin is unknown but presumed to be remnants of Creation itself.

## Halflife

Starmetal is a one use material, impossible to reforge in it's pure state, once it's power is used the impurity's of reality and entropy begin to effect it and will slowly degrade into Aetherium.

## Taste

Being comprised of Creation itself the metal tastes of whatever the holder wishes it to.

## Odor

Being comprised of Creation itself the metal smells of whatever the holder wishes it to but often accompanied with a strong smell of ozone.

## Colour

A very bright white/cyan core licked with arcane violet flame.
