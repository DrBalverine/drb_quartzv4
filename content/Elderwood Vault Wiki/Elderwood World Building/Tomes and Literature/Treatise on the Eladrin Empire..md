## Contents

In the caverns of old, ugly and obscure, shines the gold of truth.

Enveloped in infamy are the ancient kin of the high elves, enigmatic and ruthless the world still bears the scars of their cruelty, the long dead Eladrin.

There are few societies in Elderwood history that can boast the same potential as this race of elves.

They were wise, magically gifted and ambitious but their legacy was built on hubris.

If there's one lesson to be learnt from studying the Eladrin it is that an empire built on stone and steel will succeed but an empire built on blood, bones and brutality will break.

The benevolent Numina teach their worshippers to be just and pure with each other a lesson the ancient Eladrin chose to ignore at their eventual peril for when their pride ceased to obscure their vision it was already too late.

The Eladrin famously said �Wear lore as your armour� but the wisdom of their lore was overcome by their lofty ambition and they resorted to cruelty and corruption to build their bloody Empire.

The Eladrin were once a prosperous race and remnants of their magnificent structures still defy the elements and the wear of time in Elderwood to this day. 

History does not look kindly on the ancient Eladrin, who rose to dominance on the Elderwood mainland forming an extensive empire from shore to shore.

One crucial difference between the eladrin and their elven kin is their respective Pantheon's. The Eladrin were the first to worship the Numina we know today and did so indiscriminately.

While other elven societies cut ties with The House of Tyrants (The Evil aligned Numina) the Eladrin cared little for the distinction between the good and the bad gods.

The ancestors of the elven population of Elderwood today saw this difference, however subjective that may be, and were fearful of the gods accepting their aid with a great deal of caution. They acknowledged how Ligatha�s attitude could teach them martial honour and how to deal retribution. They fed Kohannya�s vanity in exchange for her valuable domestic and artistic knowledge and they studied Vitrius� perfection to better order and govern themselves. 

Crucially what the High Elven ancestors also did was isolate the four most malevolent gods in their estimation and they warned their people not to meddle with them. These four dark gods became known as the House of Tyrants and consisted of Krauga Igrazi, Imparun S'gath, Mesarack and Loucura.

However within the burgeoning Eladrin empire reverence for the numina was not initially quite so pervasive but when it took hold it was insidious quickly spreading like a silent plague. Unlike their High Elf kin the Eladrin did not allow morality to dictate the focus of their worship and quickly their veneration was focused on the entities who could best serve the interests of the empire. 

To no surprise the more reprehensible members of the Numina were the ones to eagerly capitalize on this arrangement with even the most heinous gods subsequently the target of mass worship at the forefront being Krauga Igrazi the tyrannical god of domination and pain.

The gradual corruption of the Eladrin conscience across that ancient era lost to time reeks of Krauga�s fell influence.

The Eladrin began brokering deals with the gods, acquiring blessings and greater power and an unprecedented rate. 

All of their dealings with the Numina helped them grow their empire but it was within Krauga�s divine domains that the Eladrin truly excelled. 

With overwhelming force, an iron fist and the aid of demon armies the Eladrin preyed upon all they encountered. Vulnerable, outnumbered and needing societies were turned into vagrants as the Eladrin empire�s surged forward over the land raiding settlements killing the useless and making slaves of all those capable of working. Slavery, domination and cruelty were the order of the hour and no doubt Krauga was satisfied to see it.

On the backs of countless thralls, the Eladrin created a booming society. The subjugation of entire races brought prosperity the likes of which have never been seen since.

Captives/slaves were utilized for agriculture, building and the maintenance of their empire�s glorious infrastructure and architecture but most egregious of all slaves would be turned into sources of entertainment.

To worship a tyrannical god is a perilous endeavour without restraint and it is no wonder why revering a sadistic prince lead to the entire race becoming sadistic themselves. 

However it is to be expected that the few remaining records of eladrin were documented by their former victims and as such portray them as monstrous bellicose tyrants.

With their ill gotten powers and domination came great growth. Soon the eladrin had built a wondrous Empire on the shoulders of innumerable slaves and dark deals. It was only a matter of time before the burden proved too heavy to bear.

 All of this sprouted from one mistake, allowing dark worship to go unregulated which lead to a tragic waste of this race's potential.

The eladrin were an innovative people with a unique outlook on the universe. Magic was an enormous aspect of their society and were the first to treat magic as an academic skill to learn, a distant ancestor of modern wizardry. 

The eladrin constructed the first idea of the world being formed of distinct elements. They believed the world was composed of four elements earth, water, air and light not fire but light.

This last element was the focal point for much of their culture and architecture they considered starlight to be the sublime element that linked the mortal realm to the realm of the gods.

This explains their Wells of magic, forged from meteoric iron to harness the energy of the stars. Even now thousands of years after they were abandoned mages can still replenish their power at these wells. They cut meteoric glass into large enchanted gems which could store magical auras. Unfortunately the eladrin fell long before they could truly tap the potential of these magics but even in the early stages of development this astral magic through meteoric vessels could store and transmit memories. It is rumoured that overuse of these crystals could even cause a capacity problem for mortals.

Had the eladrin not brought about their own demise they could have achieved so much but instead these ancient sorceries remain tragically untouched.

When the eladrin were consumed by avarice and turned to the Numina for help it was unfortunate had they been patient and honest in their advancements they surely would have reached the same heights eventually but instead with brutality their empire flourished at an alarming pace, a pace not possible through honest means.

The slavery itself was not the crux of their cruelty. The government of various elderwood regions permit slavery but the eladrin haven gained great infamy for the practice. History often isn't fair and the victors write the history. This is true but in this case their reputation is well deserved.

The main reason the eladrin are perceived to be the worst the most arrogant and the most sadistic race in elderwood history is because of their merciless choice of entertainment, the sadistic art tortures created by the eladrin.

Their slaves were so undeserving of basic mortal rights that butchering them did not evoke any remorse or empathy in the masses of elves. Some men would become tortuous art installations for the strange pleasures of their masters such as the wailing wheels of Vindasal, the gut gardens of Cersin and flesh sculpture which was everywhere among the slaves of the eladrin in those dark days.

Worse still was the realms of the fire King H�ghoull where through the forced ingestion of toxins drawn from demons slaves would inhale new visions of torment so vivid as to break the mind and children were set aflame for night-time tiger sport.

The eladrin were not content to simply use slaves for practical ends their brutality knew no limits.

Slaves would build the eladrin's cultural hubs be it courtyards, galleries or arenas and the slaves would also serve as the spectacles put through unthinkable Horrors for the amusement of the eladrin.

This demonstrates just how far their debauchery had festered. Cruelty for the good of advancement can be justified if you're willing to suppress your moral compass but cruelty for pleasure is where the cultural rot set in. The eladrin let their hubris overcome their compassion and it foretold their downfall

�Heedless the wicked man turns away and forsaking the simple wisdoms granted to him by the all-wise and the all knowing gods he lives in sin and ignorance all the days of his life he bears the awful burdens of his crimes and before men and gods his wickedness is known and neither blessing nor comfort may he expect from the altars and shrines of the gods.�

For a race so fond of remembering ones lore it is ironic that the eladrin couldn't scry their destruction in the commands of their dark gods.

The harder the eladrin pulled on the chains of their servants the more severe the reckoning would be when the links finally snapped and when it came it came.

Backed by some of the radical eladrin lords who grown disillusioned by the cultural hedonism a slave rebellion toppled the eladrin kingdoms.

The benevolent gods had been patient with the eladrin giving them ample opportunity to reform but when their tyranny remained malignant they were forced to intervene.

 The high elven rebels were sent to punish the eladrin for their crimes. The Tyrant gods had offered the eladrin immediate advantages, fulfilling their superficial desires, helping them build an empire on a foundation of sand, it was destined to crumble.

From here the eladrin began to fade into obscurity some minor eladrin lords remained in power as vassals to a burgeoning Kingdom which would eventually become [[the elven sovereignty]], not all of the eladrin were complicit to the horrors that define their culture.

Regardless there has not been a sighting of a living eladrin in over a 4 thousand years and many scholars would simply say that the eladrin have gone extinct.

 However it is well-documented that an elite diaspora occurred at the falling of the eladrin empire.

Many of the eladrin sought refuge in other provinces some like the ones who attempted to sail to new land were likely wiped out by the sea serpents but others were successful.

Some made it to the burgeoning elven sovereignty as a result it is speculated that the eladrin assimilated with the other elves and their nobility. If the eladrin successfully assimilated into the nobility of [[the elven sovereignty]] that could certainly explain a lot of the elitism, subjugation of mankind and great concern for ethnic purity.

Anywhere there are elves discriminating [[Human|humans]] it is entirely possible that remnants of the old corrupt eladrin Empire are a part of the machinations they could very well be extinct but there is always a chance that they are hidden in plain sight plotting their revenge on the race�s of elderwood and the gods who betrayed them.
