# Kessel Sabacc Set with Deck, Dice, 16 chips, Starter Shift Tokens



Inspired from Star Wars Outlaws, now you play Kessel Sabacc in real life with your friends! The deck contains 3 cards for each value per family (including the imposter), and 2 Sylops for a total of 44 cards—the same as the deck in Star Wars Outlaws.

Set includes Kessel Sabacc Deck, Spike Dice, and 4 starter Shift Token sets.

I’ve based the designs on Coaxium and Spice the two main exports of Kessel. The deck has all of the same features as the sabacc deck from Star Wars Outlaws.
