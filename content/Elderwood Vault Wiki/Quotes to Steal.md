"Steel your heart little phoenix. I hear its quiver - let it drum a warriors march. Fly onward, the night shall cloak your path, my arrows whisper through the dark. And when the storm passed your noble sun shall rise in greater glory."


"You seem so noble and unyielding, a true knight - yet you shiver and whine like a restless wolf cub"
