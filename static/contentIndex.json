A guardian or challenge at the entrance is a good justification why the location remains intact.\nAlso, a guardian sets up early action to capture player interest and energize a session.\nRoom One challenge ideas:\n\nThe entrance is trapped.\nThe entrance is cleverly hidden.\nThe entrance requires a special key, such as a ceremony, command word, or physical object.\nThe guardian was deliberately placed to keep intruders out. Examples: a golem, robot, or electric fence.\nThe guardian is not indigenous to the dungeon and is a tough creature or force who’s made its lair in room one.\nThe entrance is hazardous and requires special skills and equipment to bypass. For example: radiation leaks, security clearance, wall of fire.\n\nRoom One is also your opportunity to establish mood and theme to your dungeon, so dress it up with care.\nRoom Two: Puzzle Or Roleplaying Challenge\nThe PCs are victorious over the challenge of the first room and are now presented with a trial that cannot be solved with steel.\nThis keeps problem solvers in your group happy and breaks the action up for good pacing.\nMake Room Two a puzzle, skill-based, or roleplaying encounter, if possible.\nRoom Two should shine the limelight on different PCs than Room One, change gameplay up, and offer variety between the challenge at the entrance and the challenge at the end.\nNote, if Room One was this type of encounter, then feel free to make Room Two combat-oriented.\nRoom Two should allow for multiple solutions to prevent the game from stalling\nRoom Two ideas:\n\nMagic puzzle, such as a chessboard tile floor with special squares\nAn AI blocks access to the rest of the complex and must be befriended, not fought.\nA buzzer panel for all the apartments, but the person the PCs are looking for has listed themselves\nunder a different name, which can be figured out through previous clues you’ve dropped.\nA concierge at the front desk must be bluffed or coerced without him raising the alarm.\nA dirt floor crawls with poisonous snakes that will slither out of the way to avoid open flame. (A\nfew might follow at a distance and strike later.)\nThe PCs must convince a bouncer to let them in without confiscating their weapons.\n\nOnce you’ve figured out what Room Two is, try to plant one or more clues in Room One about potential solutions.\nThis ties the adventure together a little tighter, will delight the problem solvers, and can be a back-up for you if the players get stuck.\nRoom Three: Trick or Setback\nThe purpose of this room is to build tension. Do this using a trick, trap, or setback. For example, after defeating a tough monster, and players think they’ve finally found the treasure and achieved their goal, they learn they’ve been tricked and the room is a false crypt.\nDepending on your game system, use this room to cater to any player or character types not yet served by the first two areas. Alternatively, give your group a double-dose of gameplay that they enjoy the most, such as more combat or roleplaying.\nRoom Three ideas:\n\nThe PCs rescue several prisoners or hostages. However, the victims might be enemies in disguise,\nare booby-trapped, or create a dilemma as they plead to be escorted back to safety immediately.\nA collapsed structure blocks part of the area. The debris is dangerous and blocks nothing of\nimportance, another trap, or a new threat.\nContains a one-way exit (the PCs must return and deal with Rooms One and Two again). i.e.\nTeleport trap, one-way door, 2000 foot water slide trap.\nThe PCs finally find the artifact required to defeat the villain, but the artifact is broken, cursed, or has parts missing, and clues reveal a solution lies ahead.\nBelieving the object of the quest now lays within easy reach, an NPC companion turns traitor and\nbetrays the PCs.\n\nAnother potential payoff for Room Three is to weaken the PCs as build-up to a dramatic struggle in Room Four.\nIt might contain a tough combat encounter, take down a key defence, exhaust an important resource, or make the party susceptible to a certain type of attack.\nFor example, if Room Four contains a mummy whose secret weakness is fire, then make Room Three a troll lair (or another creature susceptible to fire) so the PCs might be tempted to burn off a lot of their fire magic, oil, and other flammable resources.\nThis would turn a plain old troll battle into a gotcha once the PCs hit Room Four and realize they are out of fire resources.\nDon’t forget to dress Room Three up with your theme elements.\nRoom Four: Climax, Big Battle or Conflict\nThis room is The Big Show. It’s the final combat or conflict encounter of the dungeon.\nUse all the tactics you can summon to make this encounter memorable and entertaining.\nAs always, generate interesting terrain that will impact the battle.\nStart or end with roleplay.\nMaybe the bad guy needs to stall for time to let PC buffs wear out, to wait for help to arrive, or to stir himself into a rage.\nPerhaps the combat ends with the bad guy bleeding to death and a few short words can be exchanged, or there are helpless minions or prisoners to roleplay with once the threat is dealt with.\nRoom Four ideas:\n\nGive the bad guy unexpected powers, abilities, or equipment.\nPrevious rooms might contain warning signals or an alarm, so the bad guy has had time to prepare.\nThe bay guys try to settle things in an unusual way, such as through a wager or a duel.\nThe lair is trapped. The bad guy knows what or where to avoid, or can set off the traps at opportune moments.\nThe bad guy reveals The Big Reward and threatens to break it or put it out of the PCs’ so reach so they’ll never collect it.\nThe bad guy has a secret weakness that the PCs figure out how to exploit.\nA variety of PC skills and talents are required to successfully complete the encounter.\n\nRoom Five: Reward, Revelation, Plot Twist\nHere’s your opportunity to change the players’ bragging to “we came, we saw, we slipped on a banana peel.”\nRoom Five doesn’t always represent a complication or point of failure for the PCs, but it can.\nRoom Five doesn’t always need to be a physical location either - it can be a twist revealed in Room Four.\nRoom Five is where your creativity can shine and is often what will make the dungeon different and memorable from the other crawls in your campaigns.\nIn addition, if you haven’t supplied the reward yet for conquering the dungeon, here is a good place to put the object of the quest, chests of loot, or the valuable information the PCs need to save the kingdom.\nAs accounting tasks take over from recent, thrilling, combat tasks, this would also be a good time to make a campaign or world revelation, or a plot twist.\nPerhaps the location of the next 5 Room Dungeon is uncovered, along with sufficient motivation to accept the quest.\nMaybe the identity of the bad guy is revealed. New clues and information pertaining to a major plot arc might be embedded in the treasure, perhaps sewn into a valuable carpet, drawn in painting, or written on a slip of paper stuffed into a scroll tube or encoded on a data chip.\nRoom Five ideas:\n\nAnother guardian awaits in the treasure container.\nA trap that resurrects or renews the challenge from Room Four.\nBonus treasure is discovered that leads to another adventure, such as a piece of a magic item or a map fragment.\nA rival enters and tries to steal the reward while the PCs are weakened after the big challenge of Room Four.\nThe object of the quest/final reward isn’t what it seems or has a complication. i.e. The kidnapped king doesn’t want to return.\nThe quest was a trick. By killing the dungeon’s bad guy, the PCs have helped the campaign villain or a rival.\nPerhaps the bad guy was a good guy under a curse, transformed, or placed into difficult circumstances.\nThe bad guy turns out to be a PC’s father.\nThe true, gruesome meaning behind a national holiday is discovered.\nThe source of an alien race’s hostility towards others is uncovered, transforming them from villains to sympathetic characters in the story.\nThe true meaning of the prophecy or poem that lead the PCs to the dungeon is finally understood, and it’s not what the PCs thought.\n"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/DM-Tools/Translators":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/DM-Tools/Translators","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/DM Tools/Translators.md","title":"Translators","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"valhyr.com/pages/rune-translator"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/DM-Tools/Useful-Links":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/DM-Tools/Useful-Links","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/DM Tools/Useful Links.md","title":"Useful Links","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"jdgwf.github.io/ffg-sw-genesys-helpers/"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Items/Consumables/Alchemical-Plants/Visas-Kepheros-Glasshouse-Plants":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Items/Consumables/Alchemical-Plants/Visas-Kepheros-Glasshouse-Plants","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/Items/Consumables/Alchemical Plants/Visas Kepheros Glasshouse Plants.md","title":"Visas Kepheros Glasshouse Plants","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\nWhisperroot (Silensia subterranea)\nA pale, fibrous root that when chewed, renders the user completely silent for 10 minutes—even their thoughts are muffled.\nOften the cause of eerie silences in woodland glades.\n\n\nSuncry Berry (Solilux rubens)\nEmits faint luminescent weep when ripe; consuming it causes tears to glow for 10 minutes.\n\n\nFogmelon (Cucumis nebulis)\nCracking it open fills a ten-foot radius with thick, ankle-deep fog that smells faintly of wet laundry.\n\n\nDevil’s Nougat (Apis infernica secretionis)\nA chewy bee secretion inducing mild “possession by a demon of gluttony”, extreme feelings of hunger.\n\n\nInkblossom (Floravox obscura)\nBrewed tea causes the drinker to vomit perfectly legible script onto parchment.\n\n\nJellyvine Pod (Gelatus creepera)\nEdible jelly that alters gravity for the eater by 90 degrees.

The major locations are The Elven Sovereignty ( the area ruled over by the elven ruling faction of the same name), The Human Reserve ( a vassal area that was given by the Elven Sovereignty to Humans and other races to govern themselves in), The Frozen North ( a vast area of icey tundra that was devastated by a great magical calamity, the area is now the territory of very dangerous demons), The Desiccated Isle ( a desert country with a society of undead with ancient Egyptian stylings) , Drakenmyre ( an area of haunted swamps and gothic castles, ruled by vampires) , Xameer ( an unexplored continent that hides a dragonborn empire)."},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/LMM-Overview/Section-Seven-Current-Events-and-Conflicts":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/LMM-Overview/Section-Seven-Current-Events-and-Conflicts","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/LMM Overview/Section Seven Current Events and Conflicts.md","title":"Section Seven Current Events and Conflicts","links":["Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/LMM-Overview/THE-LIST"],"tags":[],"content":"THE LIST\nDiscuss ongoing conflicts, political tensions, or looming threats in your setting.

Provide information about their ideologies, motivations, relationships with each other, and any ongoing conflicts or power struggles.\n\n\nThe Elven Sovereignty: The ruling noble faction of Elderwood. They rule over the other nations but after the ruin of the north their territory is no longer bigger than their vassals. The Elven Sovereignty is made up of solely High elves, called such only to distinguish themselves against their Wyld Elf cousins.\nThe Elven sovereignty began when the elves overthrew the tyrannical Eladrin Empire. They have picked up some of their former oppressors traits and the elven sovereignty of today has a reputation for being oppressive, corrupt, proud, arrogant and snobbish.  They wish to maintain their power by whatever means and not show weakness to the other races.\n\n\nThe Bureau: The intelligence and security service for The Elven Sovereignty. They are highly skilled agents, tasked with secret missions to serve the interest of The Elven Sovereignty or at least the nobles with enough influence.\n\n\nThey do the underhanded secret dirty work that keeps the Elven Sovereignty in power.\n\n\nBrass Elves: Magi-tech adept isolationist elves, they hide in great underground citadels where in they create fantastical works of artifice in their vast workshops. They are the creators of the Fabricants (beings similar to warforged) They are vassals under The Elven Sovereignty but care more for their craft than politics. They originally went into isolation as they predicted a great calamity and protected themselves from it by locking their civilisation in vast underground citadels. Now one such citadel has reopened and they search for the other citadels which are now lost.\n\n\nWyld Elves: Druidic cousins to the elven sovereignty. They rejected the more metropolitan life that the Sovreignty became and focus on maintaining harmony with natural forces. They are nomadic and travel the vast forests of elderwood protecting their ancestor glades (areas of particular druidic importance). They have secret knowledge of how the natural planes function that have otherwise been lost to time. The Elven Sovereignty want to reintegrate them into their dominion but the wyld elves do not want this. Also the wyld elves clash with humanity often over use of natural resources.\n\n\nLich Lords: The previous overlords of the elven sovereignty vassal state given over for human habitation. These powerful necromancers ruled over the human population with dark forbidden magic and tyrannical oppression. They did not care for their people outside of their usefulness to their magical experiments. They were overthrown by The Silver Knight Rebellion, where a group of paladins rose up and defeated their regime. Now small necromancy cults wish to resurrect them to gain their dark powers.\n\n\nHumans (Kingdoms of Korelilon)\nThe ruling government of The Human Reserve, a vassal kingdom of The Elven Sovreignty to make a place for humans to live apart form elves. It was established after the fall of the Lich Lords. There is currently no ruling family so a council of the nobles from each area make kingdom spanning decisions. This is split into the following fiefdoms:\n\n\nDuchy of Cordagh: The most honourable of the fiefdoms. Was previously the seat of the kingdom but no longer. They try to cling onto the noble ideals of the old kingdom but struggle under elven sovereignty rulership.\nDuchy of Korag: A dark and swampy area, the current main city of this area is built on the ruins of an old Lich Lords settlement. It is now a pit of crime and corruption. The ruler of this area Master Doud is a fat corrupt man who uses his position to further his wealth at the expense of his people, using criminal organisations to keep his power.\nDuchy of Visas: Ruled by the enigmatic Lady Visas, this area is a strange and gothic. It’s capital the city called Visas is also the home of The Crystal college and a large Synod presence. Visas have few greater political goals as Lady Visas is often silent of most issues. Personal freedom and ambition are encouraged.\nCrossroads County: Placed at the intersection of 2 great trade routes through the forest of ancestors Crossroads is a peaceful and prosperous district. They are accepting of all peoples as they pass through and support the needs of the races other than human and elf strongly.\n \n\nThe Synod of The Radiant Accord\n\nThe primary religious authority in Elderwood with shrines in most towns and villages. Their main seat is in the Duchy of Cordagh\n\n\nWizards of The Crystal College\nMaster of magic and the mystic arts, the wizards of the crystal college are consummate academics. The college is named after the memory crystals apon which the wizards pour their knowledge into. They are more focused on the discovery of knowledge than morality but they are also the first and last line of defence against threats to the world from outside the material plane and consider it a duty of care, they are obliged to aid people with magical problems.\n\n\nThe Troupe of Fools\n\n\nJesters, bards, actors and all sort of performers. In their position they have the power to influence popular opinion and culture to sway the political\n\nDemons of the North\n\nThe Northern wastes was at one point a vast area making up over half of the elven sovereigntys territory. Due to a magical cataclysm a rip in the planes was created between here on the material plane and the hells. This allowed demon hordes to pour through and invade. This was only quelled by the creation of the Spirit Fence, a vast continent spanning structure that repels them and keeps them contained. The demons agenda is to punish, corrupt and conquer.\n\nDrakenmyre Vampyrium\n\nThe gothic vampire kingdom.\n\nThe Myrequi\n\nThe underground resistance against the Drakenmyre Vampyrium\n\nDessicated isle (Crimson Court)\n"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/LMM-Overview/Section-Two-Geography-and-Locations":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/LMM-Overview/Section-Two-Geography-and-Locations","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/LMM Overview/Section Two Geography and Locations.md","title":"Section Two Geography and Locations","links":["Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/LMM-Overview/THE-LIST","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Groups-and-Organisations/The-Elven-Sovereignty","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Human-Reserve/The-Human-Reserve","the-Human-Reserve","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Human-Reserve/Visas/Visas","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Groups-and-Organisations/The-Synod","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Brass-Elves","Brass-elves","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/Shar-Mzark/Cogdoor/Cogdoor","human"],"tags":[],"content":"THE LIST\n\nGeography and Locations:\n\nThe major Areas are; The Elven Sovereignty, The Human Reserve, The Northern Wastes, The Desiccated Isle, Drakenmyre and Xameer.\nEach of these countries has several notable locations within, here is an overview of them.\nThe Elven Sovereignty:\n\nAurora-Sylvadis, the capital of The Elven Sovreignty and by extension all Elderwood. An ancient Elven city built on the remains of the capital of a long gone Eladrin Empire.\nGroaroths Fall\nA settlement built around a waterfall and the remains of a dead Titan. This area is currently inhabited by Orc refugees who have fled the demons in The Frozen North.\nSulchin Ger, The primary settlement of the Taurus (a minotaur-like species) it is surrounded by great plains.\nThe House of Aljana, another Elven town similar to Rivendell.\nPort Tijara, the largest port city in Elderwood and a hub for trade and commerce.\n\nThe Human Reserve:\n\nCordagh Citadel, a mighty fortress capital of the Human Reserve. The great citadel similar to Minas Tirith. It sits outside of the Forest of Ancestors which covers most of Elderwood and is surrounded by farmland.\nVisas, Seat of knowledge and religion for Elderwood. This dark broody city is split into many districts the most notable being, The Crystal College: The foremost institute of wizardry, The Synod: The great cathedral district, The Grim: a haunted area cursed by a magical accident, The Palace District: Where nobles and Lady Visas the city’s enigmatic ruler live, The Warrens: a great underbelly of the city made up of numerous uncharted tunnels.\nGravesford, A major settlement of the Lich Lords who used to rule the Human Reserve until a rebellion vanquished them. It sits on a river and was a place of major industry for them.\nRoc Fell, a tall mountainous region that houses the citadel of the hawklords (an aarakokra-like species), agents of the god of justice train here.\nBriarspring, a small village that sits on top of an evil temple. A priest of the nature god planted magical roses around the town’s water supply that wards off the evil from below. The players have defeated the priestess of this temple and everything is fine now. The temple also houses a locked door to the underdark.\n-Crossroads, sitting in the middle of many trade routes and at a good rest stop for a journey through the forest of ancestors Crossroads is a prosperous town where most will pass through at some time when journeying around elderwood.\nKher Muldur, the surface side fortress of the dwarves where they trade with other peoples. Kher Muldur has extensive mines and long underground canals which allow shipments of goods almost anywhere in elderwood.\nKorag Fens, a large swamp and marshland with a few settlements such as the town called Korag, Bogwood and the ruined Doud. The primary industries of this area revolve around peat and crime.\nShar Mzark, the hub of Brass Elf civilisation where magical and technological wonders can be found. The Brass elves are slightly isolationist and use fabricants (similar to warforged) for most mundane tasks. This is one of many Brass Elf colonies but most are lost and forgotten. There is a city built around where Shar Mzark meets the surface overground called Cogdoor.\n\nThe Frozen North:\n\nThe Great Gate, a powerful defensive fortress that acts as the only enterance through The Spirit Fence. The Spirit Fence is a vast magical structure than cuts across the entire land splitting the Elven Sovreignty off from The Frozen North (Sometimes called The Northern Wastes). This barrier is powered by souls of ancestors and repels the demon hordes that hunt In the Frozen North.\nThe Grey Keep, The last great bastion of Goliath kind. So few Goliath are left after the ruin of the north that they congregate at The Grey keep hoping to do great things and be remembered before their species dies out.\nThe Ice Ringed Chaos, a jagged mountain range centred on a vast volcano. This volcano is magical in nature and is a literal wound in the world from which demons can crawl out. This concentration of energy saps warmth from the region making The Frozen North into the ice blasted wasteland it is today.\nThe area of The Frozen North also has many other points of interest. Many of these are ruined or abandoned structures from before the ruin of the north occurred (The Ruin of The North is the name for the event which created the ice ringed chaos) examples are; ancient wizard towers, fortress ruins now inhabited by demons, evacuated towns left abandoned etc etc.\n\nThe Desiccated Isle: This island is separated from Elderwood mainland by a stretch of ocean called The Salt Aegis.\n\nKult Hadarra, the seat of power and capital of The Dessicated Isle. This vast city surround the lake of blood which spews from the ziggurat at the center of  a vast lake. Inside this ancient ziggurat resides The Vermillion Shround, most ancient and powerful of all the vampires of The Dessicated Isle. The rivers that flow from this Ziggurat are called The Great Vein and they split the isle into four quadrants. The Sinking Fields, The Nihiyat Dunes, The Damar Plains and The Sapphire Rift.\nOther notable location on The Dessicated Isle are The Sorched Bastille, a perilous prison and Canid Cove a shelter for Kobold Pirates.\n\nDrakenmyre: Drakenmyre has yet to be fully fleshed out but I have some notes of a few locations. Overall it should have a very gothic theme, large swamp areas and pine forests.\n\nJagentear Dell, a werewolf settlement inspired by the Cossacks and Tatars.\nPort Gespenstein, a haunted port which houses a cathedral to the undead that keeps the towns population eternally in spirit form. They harvest ectoplasm for rituals.\nFuergard Gruft, an afflicated town with vast catacombs and a problem with wraiths. The ruined Flamtaer ( a temple dedicated to funeral pyres) could be the solution.\nMouldenberg, a human settlement under the rule of the Drakenmyre overlords. They keep the people in line by demanding tithes of blood. This town hides a secret resistance to The Drakenmyre rulers. It also houses a grove of bloodwood trees. The bloodwood tree is an ancestor tree that grows only in places of prominent bloodshed and violence.\nMengelhaven and Schloss Sanguinesti, Mengelhaven is the capital of Drakenmyre and is a large dark brooding city reminiscent of a dark gothic 17th century era london. At it’s height is Schloss Sanguinesti the palace and noble district of the city where the noble vampires of The Drakenmyre Vampyrium reside.\nSepherinheim, a holdout of holy priests and paladins that was utterly decimated by the vampires from Schloss Sanguinesti. There may well still be artifacts hidden here that could help against the dark creatures of Drakenmyre.\n\nXameer:\n\nXameer is mostly uncharted but consists of very dangerous jungle. Hidden in the jungle is an empire of dragonborn ruled by ancient dragons. Their society has a aztec theme to it.\n\nOther Planes:\nOutside of the Material Plane which all the above are part of, there are a number of other planes of existence. These include;\nThe Elemental Planes (Air, Earth, Fire, Water)\nThese elemental planes embody the element they represent and are responsible for that elements influence on the material plane. Each has unique inhabitants that work to keep the elements in balance.\nThe Air Plane: Populated by Lepidoptra, anthropomorphic moth people. The air plane is endless skies and flying palaces of marble. The Lepidoptra are kind and take their duty seriously, revering The Great Balance, their concept of the duty to keep the elemental forces in balance between the planes.\nThe Astral Sea:"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/LMM-Overview/THE-LIST":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/LMM-Overview/THE-LIST","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/LMM Overview/THE LIST.md","title":"THE LIST","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"A World Building Checklist\nWhen a game master is working on creating a world, there are a lot of details to work out. Many a time I’ve thought I had a handle on a self-created milieu only to have a player ask for some information I’d not even thought to cover (it’s amazing what those pesky players can be interested in at times!). What I needed was a general checklist of things so that all my bases were covered, so to speak.\nTo that end, I’ve shamelessly stolen this idea. It used to be available on its own website, but it’s since gone offline. It looks like it might come up eventually again at www.btot.de, but as of this writing it’s not there yet. Luckily, I’d saved a copy. Of course, it’s been modified to my own needs, but you’re welcome to take it, leave it, or adjust it to your own needs as well.\nIt is, as ever, a work in progress.

Merril fled to the crypt and died there, hiding the evidence.\nThe party’s true task: uncover the truth of Merril’s murder, lay her spirit to rest, and decide the future of House Marrowmore.\n\n❖ Key NPCs\n\n\nBaron Edran Marrowmore – Deceased. Regretted raising Stretis. Planned to pass title to Varli.\n\n\nStretis Marrowmore – Current heir. Cold, calculating. Bastard son of the Baron and Merril. Claims to have arrived after the deaths, but this is a lie. He came the night before and was only seen by Merril and the Baron.\n\n\nVarli – Loyal maid. Secretly the Baron’s daughter. Grew up beside Stretis, unaware they are twins. Knows Merril was her mother, was told her father died. Was away from the manor during the murders.\n\n\nMerril – Former head maid. Secret partner of the Baron. Ghost now haunts the crypt. Mortally wounded by Stretis while protecting the will.\n\n\nElias Quent – Estate steward. Obsessive record-keeper. May offer cryptic observations like “Too many keys missing” or “The ledger has gaps after the Baron’s death.”\n\n\nMother Grielle – Visiting priestess who attempted to exorcise the ghost and failed. Deeply disturbed. Claims the spirit only calms when Varli is near.\n\n\nOld Darrik – Gravekeeper. Fears the crypt. Claims to have seen “Lady Merril’s ghost carrying something heavy.”\n\n\n\n❖ Adventure Hook\nStretis summons the party:\n\n“The crypt has become… hostile. Priests flee. The ghost does not want me near. I need someone to retrieve the Baron’s seal from the vault. The estate can’t function without it.”\n\nInsight DC 13: He is hiding something. Afraid, not grieving.\nAdditional Note: Due to the haunting, the Baron’s body remains unburied, sealed in a temporary coffin in the upper chapel.\n\n❖ Setup &amp; Introduction\nArrival:\nThe players arrive at Marrowmore Manor, a towering gothic estate veiled in fog. Thunder threatens rain. They are greeted first by Elias Quent, the steward, who shows them to a formal sitting room.\nCharacter Introduction Order:\n\n\nElias Quent – Dry, efficient, evasive when questioned about the murders. “A tragedy. Terrible timing.”\n\n\nStretis Marrowmore – Arrives shortly after, grim and polite. Offers the job. Avoids discussing his arrival timeline unless pressed.\n\n\nVarli – The players may meet her while exploring the house. She is quiet, wearing mourning black, but warms if shown kindness. Clearly grieving.\n\n\nMother Grielle – Found praying in the chapel. She appears shaken and may blurt fragments of her failed exorcism.\n\n\nOld Darrik – Lurking near the crypt entrance. Nervous and muttering about the dead not staying put.\n\n\nThis order builds a sense of intrigue and suspicion, setting up key relationships before the players descend into the crypt.\n\n❖ Dungeon Layout\nRoom 1: The Wine Stair (Entrance)\nDescription: A hidden stair behind the wine rack leads to the crypt’s arched threshold.

Time to put father’s training to good use.\nWhilst rummaging through Grasks old smuggling post Idril uncovers a small but sturdy rowboat, little more than a canoe but it will do.\nThe beggars of a city always make the best informants, they see all and aren’t seen. A few hot meals bought here and there and now you know where she’ll be and when.\nUnder cover of night you slip the mooring, Jam stands forlornly watching as you get smaller and smaller fading into the midnight mists over the river.\nYou can barely see infront of you but in reverse that means you can barely be seen. The river is choked with fog but the sky is crystal clear as if the clouds had landed to rest.\nYou try not to stare at the glittering starlight too much, it makes your eye ache.\nYou arrive, hide the canoe in the reeds and slip onto the estate. The guards are alert enough but no true match, you have greatly stacked the odds against them this time.\nThe bright moonlight bathes the immaculate garden in silver, turning a no doubt beautiful floral display utterly monochrome. You make it to a flintwork gardeners shed and slip inside, the roof has many large gaps and on one wall a window looks towards your target. You saw their carriage arrive just as you had,  now Lady Elana Eriyador enters the lounge, unaware of the spy with a clear view inside.\nNocking the Far Ear Flights you take aim up through the holes in the roof. These things had better be worth it Muggers don’t mug themselves and these were expensive. With a little sigh you remember your Bureau days when costs had no meaning, nothing is valued higher than the security of realm. You loose the arrow and it arcs silently up and over then down into the chimney of the low crackling fire of Eriyador’s lounge. You won’t have much time before it burns up but now you have an ear in the room, Holding your bow out you listen to the string resonate, replicating the sounds in the room.\nElana speaks to her bodyguard Captain Corsith in haughty elven tones.\n“MAHN FAHS en GWING-weg MIE-thor, PEN-seg ah EH-khwin-ar,      hahahahhaha  OO-FEYL-leer  ”\nElana - What a load of whingeing peasants, they think that they are noble, that they can win and become civilised. hahhahahahahha They can’t.\nCorsith - Forgive me my lady but why do we then waste our time on them.\nElana - Because when our Malcis gains the glory and status they crave, we will have this wretched place on a leesh. Working through them makes our actions in these lands legal, For as long as Malcis doesnt break their vows to Lady Visas we are free to undermine this city.\nCorsith - What of the necromancer? I do not see how ---\nCorsith’s query is cut of with the sound of flexing and cracking wood as a wooden bust on a table turns to look at Elana as a face begins to carve itself onto the wood.\nMalrissa - Yes QUITE, I do not approve of your choice of allies daughter of mine. This Calvus is a rot at the foundations,\nAt that voice Elana and Corsith kneel immediately and bow low to the floor before their matriarch. Malrissa Eriyador, ancient elven noble, member of sovereignty court and council , spymaster head of the sovereignty security bureau.\nElana - “they have been of great help mother, even undirected their work destabilises the region, they are a sublte poison that will weaken this land for one day when it will return to us.”\nMalrissa - “Do you wish to rule or not? Then hear me girl and listen well, the sovereignty hangs by a thread.\nThere are enemies on all sides and more from within. Foul demons from the north, betrayers beneath, sand sorcerers to the east and blood nightmares to the south. Not only that but smoke rises from Xameer.\nAmidst all this the high court to our Domina argues ceaselessly, unable to take firm action and ambassadors from unknown lands whisper and plot.\nFor this gambit of yours to succeed chaos is not enough, we cannot afford the soldiers that conquest would require, the people must be utterly broken, tyranny galvanises their will, bolsters hope, we have seen this with the fall of the clergy of rot and the silver knights. A Tyrant they will rebel against But a saviour they will love.\nBolster this Count Malcis of yours, make them a light in the darkness of your own design then finally we can once more bring the land back under our protection and have peace.\nBut hear this girl and mark it well; quell this demon threat, you cannot begin to understand the sacrifice made to hold them back. Demons are not to be trifled with, insidious beyond your understanding and cannot ever be controlled. Do not mistake their beastial forms, if you are under any illusions that you are in control then they have outwitted you and you do not even realise. Find your necromancer, bring them to heel, you will have Bureau support. Grim things scuttle in the undercity, I would start there. DO NOT fail me girl.\nElana - y-y-yes mother.\nMalrissa - And Corsith, be watchful, I can see that eavesdropper arrow from here, find them and remove them.\nCorsith wheels around and stares out of the window\nSHIT SHIT FUCK RUN RUN RUN\nSir Ernstadt of Jagatear Dell\nHe has an Igor"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/040825-Cutscene":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/040825-Cutscene","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/Session Prep/Arcs/Vice in Visas/040825 Cutscene.md","title":"040825 Cutscene","links":[],"tags":["Session-Prep","Cutscene"],"content":"**Meanwhile,\nCoronet Parade, House Malcis Stables\nA fabricant steed stands motionless on a circular dais. Its bronze musculature gleams, eyes flickering with an uncertain blue. A complex blend of braided metal forms the facsimile of sinew, it’s mechanical spine along centepede of electrum down it’s back. Though adorned with fine engravings, It was built for battle. It was built to serve. Yet brand new from the forge’s womb has not yet galloped.\nEnter Lady Eriyador, long-limbed, narrow-faced, and dressed like a wineglass made flesh. She gestures with a silver-tipped fan, though the air is still and her disdain palpable.\nTrailing her is Clinterik, a brass-elf with a monocular surgically affixed into one socket and a permanent frown etched into his oxidised features. His tools, other small fabricants wait beside him, buzzing softly.\n\nLady Eriyador (dry, melodic):\nIt hasn’t even been ridden yet. Delightfully wasteful.\nClinterik (adjusting his gloves):\nFully integrated. Living alloy. Adaptive balance algorithms. Extremely advanced. Possibly sentient.\nLady Eriyador:\nYes, how unfortunate. Make sure it forgets all that before you take it apart.\nShe walks a slow circle around the steed, examining it like a bored duchess inspecting fruit. The fabricant’s gaze follows her, silently pleading. She ignores it. Her gaze turns to Count Malcis’ Corvax, a bipedal gryphon like creature used for High tower jousting in Visas\nLady Eriyador:\nBaron Malcis must not merely fly. He must descend. Like a righteous comet. An angel with talons. I want that saddle socket grafted into the corvax’s sternum, and the shock-absorption nerves laced into its wing joints.\nClinterik:\nThat will involve—\nHe hesitates, glancing at the horse, then back to her.\n—that will involve removing its heart, it’s …core.\nLady Eriyador (snaps her fan closed):\nThen remove it. And save it for me. I want it turned into a brooch. Something tasteful. Something that says: Yes, I did this, and no, I don’t regret it.\nJust a little reminder for Rustwing next time we meet. That I am in charge.\nShe smiles, barely.

The smell clings to the throat, acrid and metallic, undercut by the rank sweetness of decay. The air is damp and heavy; each breath carries the tang of iron and the faint bitterness of alkalis. Thin green vapor seeps from the seams of brass pipes, hissing softly, whispering in the gloom.\nRacks of jars line the soot-streaked walls. The glass is milky from years of handling, and the fluid inside is the color of old  tea and reeks of vinegar. Shapes float within the mirk—specimens twisted and abhorrent.\nDr. Caustis, hunched and gaunt, stoops over a workbench. He adjusts the flame beneath a syrup-thick potion. The surface of the mixture trembles, swelling in slow, viscous pulses as if something within were breathing.\nWith a pair of long iron tongs he plucks a bloated white maggot from a shallow dish of sour mash. The maggot twists and writhes, its translucent skin so stretched you can see its pulsing gut within. Caustis dips the creature into the heated potion. It thrashes violently, its soft flesh blanching, then taking on a faint phosphorescent glow as it drinks in the liquid.\nHe raises it carefully and carries it to a bell jar that sits atop a stained oak table. Inside, a soot-grey rat crouches low, its fur patchy and damp, it’s eyes glowing faintly. Each wheezing breath spills a faint ribbon of noxious green fume that coils upward before dissipating.\nCaustis croons almost tenderly:\n“A better breath, my child. Let us gift you a moment of purity.”\nWith a careful hand he unlatches the jar. A fetid breath of noxious air escapes as he drops the maggot within. It lands upon the rat’s spine with a wet plip and immediately begins to writhe forward. Its hooked mouthparts pierce the animal’s hide; it pushes inward, forcing itself between the creature’s shoulder blades. The rat thrashes, claws scraping helplessly against the glass, while the maggot burrows deeper, leaving behind a glossy trail of greenish slime that bubbles faintly on contact with the straw.\nFor a moment the rat stills. Its ragged coughs cease. It lifts its narrow head, nostrils quivering, and draws in a long, clean breath. Its eyes, usually dull and red-rimmed, widen—clear and almost bright with clarity and cunning.\nThen the change begins. Its sides heave in violent spasms; ribs crack audibly like brittle reeds beneath a boot. Pale splinters of bone lance through its thinning skin, stretching the flesh until it splits. Black veins crawl across its snout in frantic, branching lines, and its tail coils tight as wire, snapping with a dry pop. The high, keening squeal that follows rises to a shriek before the throat tears open in a wet rip. A spray of frothy, pale blood spatters the inside of the glass, hissing and smoking where it lands.\nThe rat collapses, half-burst, twitching once before becoming still. A soft steam rises from its open ribcage, carrying a coppery, acrid tang.\nDr. Caustis does not flinch. But calmly makes notes as he kicks the tiny creatures corpse to join the mound beneath the bench. Former test subjects, a grotesque midden of progress: tiny skeletons curled like withered roots, things with half-formed limbs or too many jaws, some with slick, eyeless heads that still twitch faintly at the edge of death. The stench that rises from the heap is thick—rotting meat mingled with chemical sourness—and it seeps into every corner of the lab.\nCaustis replaces his pen, then steady and unhurried he plucks another swollen maggot. He cradles it gently, like a jeweler weighing a precious stone, and murmurs:\n“A step closer. Progress does not come cheap.”\nThe next rat thrashes wildly in its wire cage as he approaches, its claws rasping against the bars. The green potion in the vial bubbles once more, slow and deliberate, as though keeping time with a heartbeat."},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/080925-Prep":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/080925-Prep","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/Session Prep/Arcs/Vice in Visas/080925 Prep.md","title":"080925 Prep","links":[],"tags":["Session-Prep","Cutscene"],"content":"The tavern door slams open, rattling mugs on the shelves.

His hands grip the wood so tight something threatens to crack. “Have you seen the kids—have they been through here? Tell me they’ve not gone to the flood yet!”\nTorin blinks, wiping her hands on a rag, the easy calm in her manner paling under Moonwing’s urgency. “They were here about two hours ago.

He slams a sodden scroll on the bar, the wax seal broken, words inked in a script that seems to shift when glanced at.\n“He is no hermit,” Moonwing shouts, voice breaking. “He’s a chained monster.

The deeper they go, the stranger and more dangerous it becomes.\n\nRoom 1 – The Blackstone Gate (Entrance &amp; Guardian)\n\n\nSetup: The party arrives at the massive sealed gate. Blackstone walls rise like cliffs, studded with rusted wards and anti-magic sigils. The guardhouse is abandoned but the air is unnervingly warm, carrying a faint metallic tang.\n\n\nChallenge: The gate’s wards are partially broken, and magic has begun to “leak” out. The lingering magic animates scraps of clothing, broken tools, and the skeletal remains of past trespassers into twitching, half-formed guardians.\n\n\nPurpose: Introduces the area’s dangers, lets players test abilities against unstable magic, and creates the sense that even inanimate things are not safe here.\n\n\n\nRoom 2 – Streets of Glass (Puzzle or Roleplay Challenge)\n\n\nSetup: Cobblestone streets and brick facades are overgrown with strange, translucent crystal growths. They hum softly and shift color when approached, lighting the fog. The buildings’ reflections in the crystals sometimes move differently from reality.\n\n\nChallenge: Players must find a safe route without touching unstable crystal clusters—contact risks magical backlash (polymorph effects, exploding light shards, or brief possession by past residents’ memories). Some clusters are unstable and can shatter into lethal rain.\n\n\nTwist: They may see the hermit’s reflection in a shard, implying he’s watching them—but the reflection’s lips form words they can’t hear.\n\n\n\nRoom 3 – The Chimera Pack (Trick or Setback)\n\n\nSetup: A collapsed plaza, littered with market stalls now fused into grotesque shapes. Here, several warped denizens lurk—once human, now insectile or bestial hybrids. They are not entirely hostile; their intelligence flickers in and out.\n\n\nChallenge: The pack may attack, but can be bargained with. They demand food, tools, or a living “gift” in exchange for directions forward. If combat occurs, they use erratic magic surges (wild magic surges each round, some beneficial, most not).\n\n\nPurpose: Adds unpredictability, roleplay tension, and a reminder that the residents here were once people.\n\n\n\nRoom 4 – The Drowned Alley (Climax Battle or Hazard)\n\n\nSetup: A sunken lane where the river has broken in, forming a flooded passage. The water is thick and oily, littered with strange floating debris—bones turned to coral, paper that doesn’t rot, candles burning underwater.\n\n\nChallenge: The river is alive with an arcane predator—a semi-corporeal eel-like thing made of current and light. It strikes from below, tries to pull victims under, and drags them toward submerged magic fissures.\n\n\nEnvironmental Twist: The party can use unstable magic in the area (floating candles, crystal debris) against the creature—if they’re willing to risk triggering dangerous magical side effects.\n\n\n\nRoom 5 – The Hermit’s Watch (Revelation &amp; Reward)\n\n\nSetup: Beyond the drowned alley, the path rises to a slanted bell tower overlooking the district. Inside, the hermit lives in a patchwork of scavenged rooms, surrounded by wards and charms that hum in counterpoint to the Flood’s magic.\n\n\nHermit: An ancient, rail-thin figure—skin like wax, voice like rusted hinges—who speaks as if they’ve been expecting the party. They carry deep knowledge of the Flood, but speak in riddles, and their survival here is clearly not natural.\n\n\nReward: The hermit can provide a vital map, secret, or lost artifact—but demands a task in return, one that will require the party to delve even deeper into the Flood in the future.\n\n"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/130125-Session-Prep":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/130125-Session-Prep","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/Session Prep/Arcs/Vice in Visas/130125 Session Prep.md","title":"130125 Session Prep","links":[],"tags":["Session-Prep"],"content":"Downtime Activities\nTBD\n\n\n1 make a Cairn for Edna and Xol\nLepis are making a war memorial\n\n\n2 Healer to heal the pain of the armour being fused to me but happy to leave it fused\n\n\n-The Rothgar pauldron seems to have fused.\n-As if it somehow directed a killing blow to itself to save you.

Unbeknownst to most, they are all werewolves. Recently, they stole a forbidden tome on demonology—“The Graven Lexicon”—and now keep it hidden in their lair.\nRoom 1: The Den’s Gate (Entrance &amp; Guardian)\nA seedy gambling hall and fighting pit serves as the Moonfangs’ front. The air reeks of sweat and ale. The gang members eye newcomers warily.\nObstacle: To gain access to the hideout proper, the players must either:\n\nBluff their way in as gamblers, fighters, or buyers of illicit goods.\nBribe or intimidate their way past the heavily muscled doorman, a scarred half-orc enforcer named Gorran the Grinless.\nSneak in through the back, where chained-up mastiffs growl at intruders.\n\nRoom 2: The Carrion Altar (Puzzle or Roleplaying Challenge)\nThe first chamber of the warren is a wretched shrine to Krauga, littered with gnawed bones and dripping with gore. A mutilated corpse hangs from the ceiling, its entrails arranged in eerie sigils.\nChallenge: The only passage deeper is sealed by a blood-warded door, pulsing with dark magic.\n\nA riddle of hunger is scrawled in Abyssal—solving it reveals the way forward.\nA blood sacrifice (animal or humanoid) must be made to the gnoll shaman presiding over the shrine.\nDestroying the altar breaks the ward—but risks drawing demonic attention.\n\nRoom 3: The Feeding Pit (Trick or Setback)\nThe players enter a cavernous pit where the pack discards the unworthy. Half-eaten bodies rot in the corners. The gnolls above have been waiting—this is an ambush.\nComplication:\n\nA gnoll beastmaster unleashes a pack of starving hyenas to tear the party apart.\nThe ground collapses, dumping the players into a lower cavern full of feral ghouls.\nThe gnolls fight only to weaken the players—they want them captured for the final ritual.\n\nRoom 4: The Alpha’s Ascension (Climax &amp; Big Conflict)\nAt the heart of the lair, Rask Bloodmaw, the Hollowclaw Alpha, stands upon an ancient demon-forged altar. The Graven Lexicon is open before him, its pages glowing with abyssal energy. His body bulges and twists as he undergoes a final transformation, his form no longer merely a were-gnoll but something… worse.\nCombat &amp; Dilemma:\n\nThe players can try to interrupt the ritual, but doing so might shatter the altar, releasing pure abyssal energy.\nRask, now a demon-infused Were-Gnoll Tyrant, is nearly unstoppable—unless the players use silver, destroy the Lexicon, or force the moonlight enchantment to backfire.\nAny PC who has been infected may feel the hunger taking hold—will they fight it or embrace it?\n\nRoom 5: Escape &amp; Consequence (Reward &amp; Revelation)\nWith Rask defeated, the lair begins to collapse, the abyssal power within it destabilizing.\n\nThe players recover the Graven Lexicon, but it is forever altered—the pages now whisper of a “great devourer”, a being who will come for the Hollowclaw’s remnants… and those who interfered.\nAny infected PCs must now battle their own growing bloodlust—do they seek a cure, or do they embrace their new form?\nSurvivors of the Hollowclaw may scatter, but one thing is certain—the curse has spread beyond this lair, and others will rise in Rask’s place.\n\n\nMap\n\n\n1 Street Entrance from Elverpot Cove\n2 Fishing Office\n3 Dockmaster Office\n4 Steps to dock\n5 Door to Tavern “The Tritons Maid”\n6  Dog Fight Organising\n7\n8\n9\n\n\n\n10 Smugglers Dock\n11 Tavern Storage\n12\n13\n14\n15 Fight Viewing area\n16 Meat Market\n17\n18\n\n\n\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/260525/260525-Prep-Notes":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/260525/260525-Prep-Notes","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/Session Prep/Arcs/Vice in Visas/260525/260525 Prep Notes.md","title":"260525 Prep Notes","links":[],"tags":["Session-Prep","Cutscene"],"content":"Calvus stands overlooking the carnage and panic his scheme has wrought and smiles.\nThe bodies of the apprentices fleeing the scene now littered the streets where Vanta and the Cryptguard has cut them down.

A glint from magical lights makes it almost seem alive, once struck it’s long crystalline form rings clear like a fine bell silencing the hundreds amassed for this special session.\nA pale magister in dark robes stands and speaks “Archmage our arguments have met deaf ears and so if you are willing we call upon a new speaker”\nShe gestures to the entrance where the mural of Wizards of old, guardians of time battle long forgotten horrors is carved into two story tall doors.\nThe entrance opens as if inviting someone home. And Calvus walks in, unhooding his cloak and looking up at the assembled court of all that is Arcane.\nHe waits for the rampant whispers to die down then speaks.\n“Archmage, My fellow Magisters, lords, ladies, wise and faithful stewards of the realm —\nI ask you: how long shall we let fear dictate our future? How long shall we deny ourselves the mastery that is our birthright? Unlike our illustrous elven overlords, death overhangs all that we do. I say Death has ruled over us for too long. It is time we ruled over death.\nYes, I know the past you fear. I know the tales of reckless necromancers, The Lich Lords, who once brought ruin to our lands. But shall we, in trembling remembrance of their failures, forever abandon the very power that could redeem us? Shall we let the crimes of the undisciplined blind us to the salvation that lies at our fingertips?\nIt was not necromancy that corrupted them. It was their weakness. Division. Lack of vision. Lack of strong, guiding hands.\nNecromancy — true necromancy, tempered by law and guided by wisdom — is no evil. It is the art of remembrance, the science of preservation, the foundation of an eternal peace.\nShall we ban the plow for fear it might become a sword? Shall we silence the scholar for fear he might lie? Shall we banish the healer for fear that he may poison?\nNo! We do not destroy tools — we teach their use. We master them.\nImagine a realm where no hero is ever forgotten, where the wisdom of our ancestors whispers still in the halls of power, where loyalty endures beyond the grave and in service eternal.\nImagine a kingdom where the greatest minds of the past advise the rulers of the present; where the bravest soldiers of old defend our walls anew; where every citizen knows that death is not an end, but a new duty to the realm.\nIf we drive necromancy into the shadows, we give it to traitors and tyrants. But if we bring it into the light, we place it under our command. Better a dangerous servant than an unstoppable enemy.\nYou fear corruption — yet what is more corrupting than weakness? You fear tyranny — yet what is more tyrannical than death itself?\nWith strong hands to guide it, necromancy will not destroy freedom — it will perfect it. True peace cannot be left to the whims of mortal weakness. True loyalty must be made unbreakable.\nI do not stand here to unleash anarchy. I stand here to forge an unshakable realm — a realm where the strong protect the weak, where order is absolute, where even The Grey Mare bends her knee to the will of the righteous.\nRe-consecrate the school of necromancy. Regulate it. Strengthen it. Crown it with law. Place it in the hands of those worthy to wield it.\nFear binds. Knowledge frees. Let strength give birth not to terror — but to eternity.\nLet us be remembered, not as the generation that cowered before power, but as the generation that mastered it with courage.\nLet us rule not only the living — but destiny itself.”\nMAGISTER VALTOR\nOld Deep Gandalf Voice\n“Lords and ladies, do not be deceived by fine words and gilded promises.\nHe speaks of peace — with armies of the dead. He speaks of loyalty — from those with no will to refuse.\nHe tells you the old tyrants failed because they were weak. No — they failed because necromancy itself corrupts. Because to command the dead is to forget the living. Because no man who walks with corpses can hold life sacred for long.\nHe offers you a world without death, but it will be a world without freedom, without mercy, without soul.\nHe does not seek to guide you. He seeks to own you — in life, and after it.\nRemember the bones beneath our fields. Remember the smoke that once blackened our skies. Remember the tyrants we tore down with blood and steel.\nNecromancy is not a tool. It is a throne built from graves.\nI say this now: better to fear death than to worship it.

Cold stone, grey light. A throne, old stone cracked like  the scars of time. Blue vapour curls from it’s base. The occupant stirs. Saint Derisor—once knight, martyr, paragon—now risen, lordly and still as the stone. Eyes faintly aglow. Armor tarnish but opulent, battle scared but ornate. A relic once again given purpose.\nBefore them stands Varchess Maelle, Speaker of the Synod. Candlelight dances in his rings. He fidgets nervously. A ruse, he and his secret master have prepared for this moment with monastic patience and a reliable guile.\nHe bows, shallowly. Anything deeper would be undignified. Or encouraging.\n\nVARCHESS MAEL\nMy saint. We welcome your request. It seems time has treated you with the reverence the living could not but alas much has come about since your … absence.\n(He watches the saint’s face. No movement. Not even disdain. Good. Or bad. Hard to say.)\n\nThey told him Derisor would be wrath incarnate. They failed to mention wrath could be silent and evidently patient. Mael adjusts the clasp of his robe and steps closer, voice warm, hands folded like a penitent serpent.\n\nVARCHESS MAEL\nMuch and little has changed. The Lich Lords lie in ruins, yes. Your sword did not miss its mark. The Silver Knights fell but fell gloriously. And then—well. You people are people.\n(No reaction. Not even the twitch of a gauntlet. Mael continues.)\n\nVARCHESS MAEL\nFor a time, we were united. Grieving but Inspired. But then the necromancers’ chains were gone, and with them—so was the order to their lives and all that made it possible. We burned their black grain, lest it poison our minds longer. But as a final insult from the dead ones, the land rotted faster than the corpses that had watered it. Famine and pestilence ruled in the stead of the old masters.\n(Still nothing. But the light in Derisor’s eyes flickers. He leans into it—gently, like easing open a wound.)\n\nVARCHESS MAEL\nBrother fought brother for bread. The War of Muck. That is what the elves called it. Never let a crisis pass without a snide remark. Civil war, hunger, plague. We warred over the slop that could one day feed us. The kingdom a churning pit of mud. And in the mud, the populus began whispering… that at least the Lich Lords brought order. Predictable doom. Easier to plan around.\n(A small shift in the saint’s posture. Mael almost smiles. Almost.)\n\nHe must not gloat. Gloating is for amateurs and… ghosts. He must offer truth like poisoned wine—sweet, vintage, and entirely drinkable.\n\nVARCHESS MAEL\nThe Council of Dukes rose from the mire. Carpe Jugulum if you will forgive the Sanginestri.  Built just enough to keep the nobles noble. But as we dared to stand once more, Then came the elven tithe—coin, grain, conscripts. Rebuilding turned to rationing. Rationing turned to riots. Hope became expensive.\n(Derisor’s gaze darkens. Mael takes one more step.)\n\nVARCHESS MAEL\nAnd just when the bleeding started to scab, civilisation returning to what had been dreamed of under the skeletal thumb… the Psychic Wars. A dragon—amethyst, grandiose and appallingly —declared war on thought itself. Cities devolved. Minds unraveled. Our spoke only mostly speak in birdsong and migraine.\n\nHe lets silence settle again. Lets the full picture fester.\n\nIn truth, Mael has waited years for this. Not for Derisor’s return, but for the opportunity it presents. A disappointed saint is far more dangerous than a triumphant one. Derisor expected hymns. Statues. A world reborn.\nThey will find only rot and a kingdom too exhausted to care.\nAnd with them, the Synod’s foundation cracks.\n\nHe speaks now in a hush. Final words. Careful as surgery.\n\nVARCHESS MAEL\nWe remembered you. Quietly. Conveniently. No statues, no songs. But prayers. Whispered, never sung. In case they were overheard.\n(The saint turns, ever so slightly. The light in their eyes is not holy. Not now.)\n\nHe feels it, the temperature dropping. A presence growing denser. The way storms gather at sea—without sound, only intent.\nMael bows again, slightly deeper this time.\n\nVARCHESS MAEL\nWe… are so very glad to have you back.\n(A pause. A crackle in the air like old thunder. Derisor steps down from the throne. Each step a sentence unspoken.)\n\nMael straightens, very carefully. He smiles.\n\nLet them fear their savior. Let him remind them why the dead once ruled."},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/290125-Meeting-with-Galvotas":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/290125-Meeting-with-Galvotas","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/Session Prep/Arcs/Vice in Visas/290125 Meeting with Galvotas.md","title":"290125 Meeting with Galvotas","links":["Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/Ally-Almanac/Wizards/Magister-Galvotas"],"tags":["Session-Prep","Cutscene"],"content":"Characters\nActi.\n\nDescription.\n\nIdril.\n\nDescription.\n\nBrass Fist.\n\nDescription.\n\nToby.\n\nDescription.\n\nEdna &amp; Xol.\n\n\nDescription.\n\n\nStrong Start\nRENDER SMELL SEE TOUCH FEEL\nToby nightmare of being chased through ancient tunnels by a shadow wearing his armor.\nTrying to follow signs, runes one will lead you\nA sputtering torch your only light in the darkness,\ncold dread ABSOLUTE FEAR grips as the flame fails, it seems the darkness holds more terrors than the being chasing you.\nRunning Triggering traps and running through but the apparition following, tanking the traps,\nMany twists and turns, a half remembered route, some signs to lead you\nunexpected T, left or right, left or right THIS WASN’T THE PLAN\nopen into a cavern, a long thin stone arch now the bridge,\nyou light the brazier and the runic door door glows\n“speak the words etched upon thine heart”\nyou panic and words fumble out in incoherently\nNothing happens, the apparition reaches the bridge closing in.\nfinally speak the words and the runes glow, the door opens, hope burns in your heart you turn and run\nAll too late you see the figure on the other side of the door, Calvus, crackling necrotic energy engulfs you and you awaken in panic\nScenes\n\nSmall scene description.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecrets and Clues\n\nSecret description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic Locations\nLocation: aspect, aspect, aspect\nLocation: aspect, aspect, aspect\nLocation: aspect, aspect, aspect\nLocation: aspect, aspect, aspect\nImportant NPCs\nMagister Galvotas.\nName.

The walls are ornately carved in the Vissian royal style, but they are old, cracked, and deeply weathered. Time has turned splendor into squalor; damp streaks mar the stone, and faint rivulets drip into unseen pools. All is silence and darkness save for the skittering of a rat. Its tiny claws echo in the gloom as it pauses, sniffing the air. Then, it watches with unsettling intent as two shadows materialize in the corridor.)\nNarration: (Optional) _“The Hour of the Wolf descends, Nigh is the time for dark deeds and the players move their pieces across the board”\n(The Acolytes step forward, their movements unnaturally fluid, their sable kebbit wraps muffling their steps. The rat retreats into the shadows but lingers, its beady eyes glinting faintly in the dim light. For a brief moment, its gaze seems too knowing, too deliberate. The cultists proceed purposefully, the air around them heavy with unspoken menace.)\n(They approach a large iron-studded wooden door. The sight hatch scrapes open, revealing two ivory, eyeless sockets—empty yet alive with flickering green embers. Recognition glimmers within them before the door groans open. The cultists step inside.)\n(The chamber beyond is a macabre study. Bones are stacked in disorganized masses upon stone shelves, their haphazard arrangement resembling a grotesque library. The faint stench of decay hangs in the air overpowered just by ongoing alchemy. A large desk, upon closer inspection, is a stone sarcophagus. Seated before it is Magister Calvus, silhouetted against the faint glow of a smoldering brazier. His hooded robes are trimmed with mink, a rich defense against the frost that clings to the city’s bones. Such is Winterveil in Visas. The flickering firelight dances over his face, casting deep, shifting shadows.)\n(The door closes with a resounding thump_, the sound swallowed by the oppressive silence. The cultists bow their heads briefly before speaking.)_\nCultist 1: “Master Calvus, we have scouted and sealed the nearby tunnels. This refuge will be secure for now. The criers claim the Laughing Plague is contained, but this is a lie. The nobility’s partitioning of the infected districts is merely a stalling measure. Half the Moonlight District is now ‘contained’ so they claim.\nCultist 2: The Warrens are cut off,  no watchmen dare make the crossing to patrol it. By all logic, the plague should have overtaken it weeks ago. But we… we’ve seen no signs of infection during our missions.”\nMaster Calvus: (Leaning forward, his voice low and dangerous) “There were three of you.”\n(The cultists exchange uneasy glances. The second cultist steps back slightly, nudging his companion forward.)\nCultist 1: (Nervously) “Yes, Master… uh, you tell him.”\nCultist 2: (Hissing) “I’m not—”\nMaster Calvus: (Slamming his gloved hand on the sarcophagus) “SPEAK! Or your corpses shall finish the tale.”\n(The cultists flinch. The first one quickly steps forward and throws down an open sack. The contents spill onto the floor: a severed hand, bloodied and grotesque. Marks of the Lich Lord Cult adorn its fingers, their necromantic designs unmistakable. The flesh is charred and sulphurous, the wrist ragged, chewed apart. A burnt brand—a “T”—mars the back of the hand.)\nCultist 1: (Voice trembling) “The Flind Street leader sends… a gift.”\n(Master Calvus regards the severed hand with cold detachment. His fingers drum once against the edge of the sarcophagus before he speaks.)\nMaster Calvus: “I see. Withdraw our people from active work in that district. Observation only, for now. Until the business with the King is resolved, we cannot afford distractions. Afterwards… perhaps Vanta should pay them a visit, when she is finished in golden house . Continue your report.”\nCultist 1: (Nodding quickly) “Yes, Master. As I was saying, the ruined Undercity presents a critical weakness. The tunnels beneath the city run deeper than anyone dares explore. Only the King knows their full extent, yet his demands grow ever more erratic. If even one unsecured cellar or waste-way remains, the plague will find its way through. Yet our excavations continue as per your orders”\nCultist 2: “We’ve done as you asked, Master. Rumors spread like wildfire. The populace blames elven negligence—or malice—for the plague. Those in power suspect the Troupe, believing they’ve been bought by the Sovereignty to orchestrate this chaos. A ploy to reconquer the human realms after their losses in the north. All our fabrication of course, they seemed to want to believe it already”\nCultist 1: “Lady Visas remains silent, as ever. Our work in the Mist Quarter progresses. The dark powers there grow restless, rallied by ritual. She is distracted, diminished. Meanwhile, we grow stronger.”\nMaster Calvus: (Turning slightly, his voice a whisper that cuts through the cold) “And the College?”\nCultist 2: “In turmoil, Master. Word has reached us that Scryers’ Keep… has fallen. Suicides by the dozens, murders rampant. Cleaners were dispatched to scrub blood-written runes from every surface.”\nMaster Calvus: (Narrowing his eyes) “The runes.

But the staff whisper that the air still echoes with… voices.”\n(Master Calvus stands, his silhouette looming as the fire behind him flares briefly.)\nMaster Calvus: (Tossing a small seal to the cultists) “Take this. Recover the tomes on this list while their eyes are dim.”\nCultist 1: (Hesitating) “But Master… the Candlewights…”\nMaster Calvus: (Leaning in, his voice like iron) “Obey. I do not tolerate mysteries. An unknown is a threat. Remember your souls are safe with me.” (He steps back into the shadow.) “Now, continue.”\nCultist 2: (Swallowing hard) “Yes, Master. All this… it strengthens the Synod’s cause. Each sermon stokes the flames of rebellion. Saint Malpris the Reborn plans holy marches through the city. Our whispers inciting schism have taken root.”\n(We see the rat as it scurries back into the darkness, its eyes glinting one final time. For the briefest instant, its silhouette against the faint firelight seems… unnatural. Unseen, it slips through the cracks, vanishing into the unknown depths below. A faint sound—a skitter, a whisper, a laugh—echoes in the cold silence.)\n(Master Calvus turns back toward the brazier. He steps forward, his voice low but brimming with dark confidence as he begins to speak. The cultists freeze, their heads bowed in reverence.)\nMaster Calvus:  “The King plays his games of shadow and steel, grasping at secrets he cannot hold. The College stumbles, blindfolded by its own arrogance, and the Synod rots from within, their sermons like kindling for a flame they do not control. They clutch at threads, each convinced they pull the loom.\nBut none see the tapestry we weave. None hear the quiet closing of jaws, the slow, inevitable march of the tide. By the time they look up from their petty squabbles, it will be too late. They are already ensnared—pawns in a game they have not even begun to play. The Laughing Plague is but the opening act, a single note in the symphony of their downfall.\n(He pauses, gazing into the flickering brazier as though seeing something distant yet certain.)\n“Let them march. Let them preach. Let them rot in their castles of dust and bone. By the time they realize the wolf is among them, it will have already feasted.”\n(He turns sharply to the cultists, his voice dropping to a razor’s edge.)\n“Go now. There is much yet to do”\n(He turns to his skeletal servant as the cultists rush away into the night)\n“Bring me the soul cage and Synod robes…we are going to church”\n(Scene fades to black.)"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/Cutscene---Edna-meets-The-Grey-Mare-1":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/Cutscene---Edna-meets-The-Grey-Mare-1","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/Session Prep/Arcs/Vice in Visas/Cutscene - Edna meets The Grey Mare 1.md","title":"Cutscene - Edna meets The Grey Mare 1","links":[],"tags":["Cutscene","Session-Prep"],"content":"Edna meets The Grey Mare\nDeath is a doorway.  The first step to innumerable paths.  It is prudent to prepare your route, but do not worry, for there is a guide.\nWe see Palace Tyria, it’s dark stone and living clay.  We hear the rumble of thunder followed by a blinding flash of the astral storms.\nAs we draw closer, the sounds of battle ring out, the Palace dungeon alive with chaos.\nWe hear their cries of triumph…turn to cries of utter despair.\n… … … … … … … … … … … . .\nEdna, you…stand up.  \nThe coldness imparted by the stone floor beneath you begins to dissipate, though there is an ache in your chest—a hollow reminder of your end— that fades a little slower.\nYou step out of a growing pool of crimson at your feet and pull your shawl around you against the ghostly chill.\nA muted, grey-green light now bathes the scene as you take stock. The shadows in the Palace dungeon are long and dark, threatening to eclipse everything.\nYou dare not look behind you. You know who lies there.\nYou knew what you were doing and have no regrets.\nAs you take in the hazy scene before you, the sound of voices…your friends’ voices: muffled, distorted, as if heard through deep water.\nBut suddenly, much more prominent, is the sound of hooves on stone.  Sharp and rhythmic, they echo closer. The rhythm is unrelenting, but there is no sense of urgency.\nYou peer into the gloom for the source and find two white shining eyes meeting yours.  Eyeshine like that of an animal, but taller, moving with a fluidity that defies comprehension.\nA feeling of…expectancy overcomes you, as if you are being called from a waiting room.\nA voice, familiar and kind, calls to you. It is the voice you had longed to hear, a voice that carries a tone of assurance, of inevitability, as if this meeting had been fated since your first breath.\n“My dear Edna, come now, sit with me.”\nThe voice resonates not in your ears, but within your very being, striking a chord so deeply rooted it feels as though it has always been there, waiting to be plucked.\nAs your eyes focus, you see that the two glowing orbs hover above a crude table and chairs, fashioned from silver birch branches lashed together with twine, adorned with clusters of scarlet berries.\nYou take another step forward, and the dungeon dissolves to that of a small cottage kitchen. The cold, damp air gives way to the faint scent of spring blooms and the warmth of candlelight. The pale glow of moonlight filters through an unseen window, casting gentle shadows.\nThe transformation is almost imperceptible, but with each step, the chaos of the past fades into something more intimate, more…introspective. The table feels impossibly familiar somehow, as if you’ve sat here before…in another life.\nSitting down, you are enveloped by the strange luminescence that clings to the scene. Only then do you see the full form of the being opposite you across the table.\nThe collector. The guide. The Grey Mare.\nTowering over you,12 feet tall, their skeletal form is draped in an unending cascade of white shawl that pools upon the ground. The bright starlight eyes are set within the sockets of a horse’s skull, its pale surface etched with intricate, ancient runes that shimmer faintly in rhythm with their speech.\nA wreath of spring crowns the skull, bursting with vibrant flowers and greenery. Ribbons of brilliant colour cascade down from the crown, their movement seemingly caught in the wind. You watch as an occasional petal falls, withers mid-air, and lands on the tabletop like a fragment of decay. Though it seems impossible for a being like this to breathe, you think you hear the faintest sigh. With it, the blackened petal crumbles to dust and vanishes on the breeze.\nWithin the cascading robes lies only endless darkness, a void that hints at a power far greater than the form they have chosen.\nThe great skull tilts, its glowing eyes regarding you. It does not look at your body; it peers beyond, into the very essence of you.\nA skeletal hand emerges from the robes, its joints creaking faintly as long fingers proffer an empty chalice in your direction.\n“You had better get out your brandy, my love; this is not a talk to be had dry.”\nYou retrieve the special reserve—purely medicinal of course—and fill the chalice.\nThe Grey Mare reclines slightly as they take the cup, no less imposing given their relaxed posture.\nAs they sip from the cup, the ivory maw somehow savouring the act, the Grey Mare speaks again.\n“Edna dear, your rest is well-deserved, but I cannot take you to the thereafter yet. It is not yet time for judgment.”\n“Be glad, little one. It is humbling for the gods that you can still find ways to confound them.  By Nithra and Xarphious’ will, I must be here. But I am inclined to return you.”\nAs they gesture towards the cottage door, you look down and realize the chalice is now in your hands. The transition was seamless, as if it had always been there.\nUpon the table sits the Collar of Xolganath, at last removed. It gleams with an unnatural solidity, its presence more real than anything else in the room. From it emanates the voices of your friends, faint and distorted. You know they call for you, but their words are just beyond reach, tethered to a place you can no longer touch.\nThe Grey Mare’s glowing eyes narrow slightly, a gesture more contemplative than menacing.\n“Another pair, unknowing of each other, conspires to keep you here. Great power and sacrifice from both, all to bend my ear. This juncture is rife with troubles, and your death here a pebble under the wheel.”\nThe Mare’s skeletal hand gestures toward you, the chalice growing heavier in your grip. The shadows cast by the candlelight writhe and stir as their voice deepens slightly, carrying the same weight.\n“Hold your soul as an eternal concern, Edna dear. The cycle cleanses, but it is you who shape the path. Drink deep, my dear, and sleep. My Groom will see you right.”\nAs you lift the chalice, the liquid within shimmers like moonlight on water. You drink, and as the taste lingers—both sweet and bitter—the world tilts.\nThe darkness embraces you, not as an enemy, but as a mother comforting her child. You drift into sleep, the sound of hooves retreating echoing faintly in the distance.\nYou dream of an orchard under a burnt orange sky. The sound of crackling flame in all directions\nXOL: “EDNA…IS THAT YOU, ARE YOU … ALRIGHT?”\n"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/Cutscene-Derisor-Closes-the-Cathedral":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/DM-Schemes/Session-Prep/Arcs/Vice-in-Visas/Cutscene-Derisor-Closes-the-Cathedral","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/DM Schemes/Session Prep/Arcs/Vice in Visas/Cutscene Derisor Closes the Cathedral.md","title":"Cutscene Derisor Closes the Cathedral","links":[],"tags":["Session-Prep","Cutscene"],"content":"“You wretched, faithless lot!

The upper class of vampires may now freely move in daylight by painting themselves in gold, which deflects its deadly light.\nAs such, they have substantial trade with the dwarves who mine it. With their unlimited source of blood, they have greatly advanced blood magic and as a result, become resistant to its corruption.\nThe Desiccated Isle is small but very well defended. Apart from the vampires themselves, powerful mages and the sand guard, the military of the desiccated isle is The Gilded Legion, however, they have not been seen in living memory. According to the history books, it is a VAST army of indomitable golden clad beings. It is assumed that the Crimson Court, the ruling council of powerful vampire lords who rule in the Vermillion Shroud’s absence, now controls this force.\nVampires do not turn to dust instantly if they are hit by sunlight, but they initially become very weak, especially susceptible to all damage.\nIn time they will decay, rotting quickly and their flesh peels from their bones and they will end up losing their minds if they are in that skeletal state for too long.\nHowever, the touch of blood can begin to restore them. Vampiric immortality leads many to a life of hedonism and decadence as their thirst for distraction is almost equal to their thirst for blood.\nThere is a strict hierarchy structure on the desiccated isle. It’s citizens are group into either\n\nLord (the ruling elite, the wealthy, the powerful),\nThrall (Those who serve the lords in more advanced positions, warriors, traders, researchers musicians, most non-menial work)\nSlave (The lowly and owned portion of society).\nThese chattels are disposable and insignificant). While this caste system is strict, ambition is often smiled upon if the individual is deserving. It is not uncommon for individuals to move up or down this system through great feats or failure or sabotage.\nAside from in the great cities, there is little life left on the Desiccated Isle and what remains has adapted to ceaseless unending struggle for survival. The only other native species to the isle are the nomadic Gnoll tribes, whom skirt the coastlines and venture into the dunes to hunt the isle’s monsters and the city dwelling, scheming Yuan Ti largely eclipsed by the ever-growing human population and beholden to the incumbent vampire lords.\n\nPOIs\nKult Hadarra\nNihiyat Dunes\nThe Sorched Bastille\nCannus Cove\nThe Sinking Fields"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Dessicated-Isle/The-Sorched-Bastille":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Dessicated-Isle/The-Sorched-Bastille","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/Elderwood World Building/Atlas of Elderwood/The Dessicated Isle/The Sorched Bastille.md","title":"The Sorched Bastille","links":["Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Dessicated-Isle/The-Desiccated-Isle"],"tags":["Location"],"content":"Infamous prison of The Desiccated Isle"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Drakenmyre-Imperium/The-Drakenmyre-Imperium":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Drakenmyre-Imperium/The-Drakenmyre-Imperium","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/Elderwood World Building/Atlas of Elderwood/The Drakenmyre Imperium/The Drakenmyre Imperium.md","title":"The Drakenmyre Imperium","links":["Vampyre","Werewolf","Fuergard-Gruft","Jagentear-Dell","Mengelhaven","Mouldenberg","Port-Gespenstein","Schloss-Sanginesti","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Drakenmyre-Imperium/The-Drakenmyre-Imperium"],"tags":["Location","Organisation"],"content":"Swampy, forested and gothic.

That was all before the Sorcerers’ War. Before the night the sky tore open and the gutters ran with spells gone sour. Before every experiment, every charm, every petty act of street magic was left to ferment in the broken air.\nNow, the district is sealed by blackstone walls and cold iron gates no key may open. The magic here did not fade—it thickened. It seeps into brick and marrow alike, invisible as air but heavy as lead. Its effects are cruel and without pattern: a coinflip of power or ruin. Those who bathe in it too long may wake to find their body not their own, their limbs lengthened into insectile stilts, their shadows writhing independently, or their voices replaced by the screams of birds.\nThe few who remain are scavengers, hermits, deserters and debtors, criminals too dangerous—or too valuable—to kill. Without protection, most are unmade, bodies and minds twisted into things that prowl the drowned streets on moonless nights. The water itself runs strange here, slow and viscous, carrying with it shards of crystal, bones calcified into porcelain, and the occasional disembodied eye that drifts like a seedpod, ever watchful still.\nFrom the walls, the Mana Flood seems still. Silent. But step inside, and you will find the air charged, your teeth aching with the pressure of unseen tides. Somewhere within, the magic hums, as though the district itself remembers the war—and is waiting for it to begin again."},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Human-Reserve/Visas/The-Last-Laugh":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Human-Reserve/Visas/The-Last-Laugh","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/Elderwood World Building/Atlas of Elderwood/The Human Reserve/Visas/The Last Laugh.md","title":"The Last Laugh","links":["Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/The-Party/The-Party","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Human-Reserve/Visas/Visas","Elias","Torrin","Father-Jaque","Rayner","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Groups-and-Organisations/The-Troupe-of-Fools/Vilrick-and-Zephon"],"tags":["Location","Reserve","Party"],"content":"Previously a smuggling den and fight pit for Visas criminal Grask.

By day hustle and bustle of markets and artisan workshops. At night home to several small theatres, taverns, and inns. Named after the late night activities of the district, pale magical orbs illuminating the revelry and to some the cobbled streets seem to bare the pattern of the moon phases.\n\n2: The Warrens\n\nPoorer densely populated, under control of criminals based out of Flind Street.\n\n3: High Perch Estates\n\nMore affluent |area outside the walls where noble estates, manors and grounds overlook the city from the hill. Their occupants both figuratively and literally looking down on the general populous.\n\n4: Crowfoot Terrace\n\nMain centre for exchange in the city. Where incoming and outgoing trade caravans are prepared. Multitudes of stalls, shops, and warehouses. General understanding is that the district earned its name due to the overlapping “claw-like” alleys radiating from its central plaza. Historians will also note the main tradehall being repurposed from an eladrin Corvax stable. Also home to a number of guildhalls influential to the city.\n\n5: The Mist\n\nA whole district locked down and abandoned due to a horrible catastrophe, it is still horribly haunted to this day, that occasionally spills over into other areas. Criminals can request a “Trial by Mist” wherein they are made to spend a night in The Mist and if they survive they are acquitted.\n\n6: The Manaflood\n\nArea irradiated with magic from wizard experiments long ago.\n\n7: Shardspire Ward\n\nLarge residential and commercial district dominated by a wizard academy wherein they study crystal shards left over from a war with a psionic gemstone dragon.\n\n8: Coronet Parade\n\nArea for the municipal and military factions. Coronet Parade refers to both the crown (who they serve) but also the hooves of cavalry and the soldiers plumes, made from coronet bird feathers. They parade as a show of force but also this area houses jousting arenas and other sports wherein nobles gain favour.\n\n9: Lantern Veil Wharf\n\nMore respectable docklands, hub of industry and trade. Lantern Veil refers to the numerous lanters that hang like bunting crisscrossing the streets here so work can go on all through the night.\n\n10: Duskridge Crossing\n\nWesterly entrance to the city, this area sits outside the walls and refers to crossing the moat river around the city.\n\n11: Arx Regnatrix\n\nResidence of Lady Visas enigmatic ruler of the city and the area also houses her government and noble court.\n\n12: The Fangs\n\nDocklands named after the two large towers that dominate it, remnants from larger fortifications long gone now.\n\n13: Sableston Cross\n\nHub for the city’s working-class artisans and craftsmen, their families and necessary utilities to keep the city running.\n\n14: Fellview Village\n\nVillage overlooking rolling hills to the north west of Visas. Large farming community likely under the thumb of their noble landlords.\n\n15: Pillar-Meridian\n\nCentral Island where the Synod and Crystal College have their HQ.

before Creation brought forth the Gods and Dark Ones, first the prime beasts were born. Leviathans who roamed the primal stars before the planes had coalesced. They endured for eons, seeing pantheons rise and fall. After The Elder Cataclysm the Gods remade the planes. After their war they were weak and fearful that the carrion leviathans would consume them for good. So they locked them away, bound them into the furthest reaches of creation, never to scourge the planes again. The Edicts of Menelag are not just the armistice preventing the Gods from manifesting and reigniting the war. They are also the thin membrane that keeps those cunning poisonous beasts at bay. In a way creating a new plane, a nothing space keeping the old ones from mortals home. This nothing space, this barrier requires sustenance of its own, a constant stream of individual souls, a concept the Aboleth cannot abide. In this place souls would undergo judgement before their eternal reward or punishment.

They wished to summon them for questioning without the permanent binding curse the collar demanded.\nEnter Edna who spotted the collar whilst cleaning up the chambers after another failed attempt to commune with it.\nUnaware of the collars curse they tried on the tempting jewellery and became souldbound to Xolganath.\nConcerned Xolganath might finally escape Edna and Xol were tasked with finding The Cask of Night a vessel the wizards deemed suitable to contain Xolganath and therefore safely break the link and save Edna.\nThrough their adventures it becomes clear that the soul link’s influence goes both ways and now “cursed” with mortality Xolganath begins to become more receptive to new ideas.\nThere is a clear connection between Xolganath and Amagius, another demon the party met on their travels to the Aer Plane.\nAmagius seemed to have designs that involved Xolganath and so aided the party.\nIt became apparent Xolganath was under more constraints than the collar alone. When freeing Aequita from The Voidborns clutches in the Aer Plane, Xolganath was forcibly discorporeated whenever in proximity.\nFollowing Ednas death at the claws of a Xolganath doppleganger, the real Xolganath diminished much of their reserved power to bind Ednas soul further together and stop them from passing into the spirit realm.\nIt was not enough alone and another mysterious benefactor lent their power, long enough to persuade the Grey Mare not to collect Ednas soul this time.\n\n\n                  \n                  GM Secrets \n                  \n                \n\nXolganath was previously the angel of retribution for Ligatha and consort to the goddess of justice.\nThey used their privileged position to create Aequita, a child of sorts created of their and ligaths combined power.\nThis creation, though out of love broke treaties set with the other gods in regards to creating more angels.

Know ye, then, that the fiend harbors no instinctual menace to populace nor precinct, unless explicitly instructed by the desires of Edna herself. The marauding steps taken by the demon shall be considered akin to the whisperings of her heart.\nYet, to the great consternation of the cosmos, a sobering truth must be unveiled. The essence of life that entwines Edna and Xolganath is a tapestry woven by ancient hands, such that the annihilation of the demon’s corporeal existence shall inevitably cleave the mortal thread of Edna’s own life. It is not a trifling matter, but a grievous breach of mystical equilibrium. To smite Xolganath is to perpetrate an unsanctioned execution, a felonious extinguishment of a spirit tethered to the Crystal College’s storied lineage.\nWith utmost fervor, I implore each soul who encounters this parchment to apprehend the tenuous harmony that dances betwixt Edna and Xolganath. Let each stride be marked with a gentle tread, every deliberation, mindful of the intricate interplay they orchestrate. The hallowed traditions of the Crystal College compel us to shield this bond, requiring that any engagement, be it word or deed, exudes the utmost reverence and sagacity.\nMay the luminous wisdom of bygone epochs illuminate your deliberations and deeds.\nYours in the Arcane Order,\nMagister Galvotas,\nMagister of the Crystal College, Order of the Blinded Eye, Sentinel of Timeless, Seer of Hidden Realms, Weaver of Starlight, Professor: Shrouded Scholarum, (B.Thau) (B.D.) (B.C.L) (B.Am.Ta.) (B.Es.O.) (M.Thau.) (D.Thau.)\nTo Whomsoever May Attend,\nI, Magister Galvotas of the Crystal College, inscribe this missive to unveil the enigmatic bond intertwining the fates of Edna, bearer of this letter, and the demon Xolganath.\nIt is of paramount import to understand; The demon acts solely under Edna’s will, harboring no inherent threat unless guided by her intent. It is with Edna that accountability for the actions of Xolganath fall.\nKnow that through thaumic entanglement the life threads of Edna and Xolganath are inextricably tied and to extinguish the demon is to end Edna’s life. Such an act is considered a grave transgression against The Crystal College and could release the infernal beast.\nI beseech all who encounter them to grasp the delicate harmony between Edna and Xolganath. Heed this edict and treat the matter with sagacity. May ancient wisdom guide your actions.\nYours in the Arcane Order,\nMagister Galvotas\nMaster Wizard of the Crystal College, Order of the Blinded Eye, Sentinel of Timeless, Seer of Hidden Realms, Weaver of Starlight, Professor: Shrouded Scholarum\n\n"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/The-Party/Edna--and--Xolganath/Edna-meets-The-Grey-Mare":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/The-Party/Edna--and--Xolganath/Edna-meets-The-Grey-Mare","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/Elderwood World Building/Characters and Creatures/The Party/Edna & Xolganath/Edna meets The Grey Mare.md","title":"Edna meets The Grey Mare","links":["Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/The-Party/Edna--and--Xolganath/Edna--and--Xolganath"],"tags":[],"content":"Edna &amp; Xolganath meets The Grey Mare\nDeath is a doorway.  The first step to innumerable paths.  It is prudent to prepare your route, but do not worry, for there is a guide.\nWe see Palace Tyria, it’s dark stone and living clay.  We hear the rumble of thunder followed by a blinding flash of the astral storms.\nAs we draw closer, the sounds of battle ring out, the Palace dungeon alive with chaos.\nWe hear their cries of triumph…turn to cries of utter despair.\n… … … … … … … … … … … . .\nEdna, you…stand up.  \nThe coldness imparted by the stone floor beneath you begins to dissipate, though there is an ache in your chest—a hollow reminder of your end— that fades a little slower.\nYou step out of a growing pool of crimson at your feet and pull your shawl around you against the ghostly chill.\nA muted, grey-green light now bathes the scene as you take stock. The shadows in the Palace dungeon are long and dark, threatening to eclipse everything.\nYou dare not look behind you. You know who lies there.\nYou knew what you were doing and have no regrets.\nAs you take in the hazy scene before you, the sound of voices…your friends’ voices: muffled, distorted, as if heard through deep water.\nBut suddenly, much more prominent, is the sound of hooves on stone.  Sharp and rhythmic, they echo closer. The rhythm is unrelenting, but there is no sense of urgency.\nYou peer into the gloom for the source and find two white shining eyes meeting yours.  Eyeshine like that of an animal, but taller, moving with a fluidity that defies comprehension.\nA feeling of…expectancy overcomes you, as if you are being called from a waiting room.\nA voice, familiar and kind, calls to you. It is the voice you had longed to hear, a voice that carries a tone of assurance, of inevitability, as if this meeting had been fated since your first breath.\n“My dear Edna, come now, sit with me.”\nThe voice resonates not in your ears, but within your very being, striking a chord so deeply rooted it feels as though it has always been there, waiting to be plucked.\nAs your eyes focus, you see that the two glowing orbs hover above a crude table and chairs, fashioned from silver birch branches lashed together with twine, adorned with clusters of scarlet berries.\nYou take another step forward, and the dungeon dissolves to that of a small cottage kitchen. The cold, damp air gives way to the faint scent of spring blooms and the warmth of candlelight. The pale glow of moonlight filters through an unseen window, casting gentle shadows.\nThe transformation is almost imperceptible, but with each step, the chaos of the past fades into something more intimate, more…introspective. The table feels impossibly familiar somehow, as if you’ve sat here before…in another life.\nSitting down, you are enveloped by the strange luminescence that clings to the scene. Only then do you see the full form of the being opposite you across the table.\nThe collector. The guide. The Grey Mare.\nTowering over you,12 feet tall, their skeletal form is draped in an unending cascade of white shawl that pools upon the ground. The bright starlight eyes are set within the sockets of a horse’s skull, its pale surface etched with intricate, ancient runes that shimmer faintly in rhythm with their speech.\nA wreath of spring crowns the skull, bursting with vibrant flowers and greenery. Ribbons of brilliant colour cascade down from the crown, their movement seemingly caught in the wind. You watch as an occasional petal falls, withers mid-air, and lands on the tabletop like a fragment of decay. Though it seems impossible for a being like this to breathe, you think you hear the faintest sigh. With it, the blackened petal crumbles to dust and vanishes on the breeze.\nWithin the cascading robes lies only endless darkness, a void that hints at a power far greater than the form they have chosen.\nThe great skull tilts, its glowing eyes regarding you. It does not look at your body; it peers beyond, into the very essence of you.\nA skeletal hand emerges from the robes, its joints creaking faintly as long fingers proffer an empty chalice in your direction.\n“You had better get out your brandy, my love; this is not a talk to be had dry.”\nYou retrieve the special reserve—purely medicinal of course—and fill the chalice.\nThe Grey Mare reclines slightly as they take the cup, no less imposing given their relaxed posture.\nAs they sip from the cup, the ivory maw somehow savouring the act, the Grey Mare speaks again.\n“Edna dear, your rest is well-deserved, but I cannot take you to the thereafter yet. It is not yet time for judgment.”\n“Be glad, little one. It is humbling for the gods that you can still find ways to confound them.  By Nithra and Xarphious’ will, I must be here. But I am inclined to return you.”\nAs they gesture towards the cottage door, you look down and realize the chalice is now in your hands. The transition was seamless, as if it had always been there.\nUpon the table sits the Collar of Xolganath, at last removed. It gleams with an unnatural solidity, its presence more real than anything else in the room. From it emanates the voices of your friends, faint and distorted. You know they call for you, but their words are just beyond reach, tethered to a place you can no longer touch.\nThe Grey Mare’s glowing eyes narrow slightly, a gesture more contemplative than menacing.\n“Another pair, unknowing of each other, conspires to keep you here. Great power and sacrifice from both, all to bend my ear. This juncture is rife with troubles, and your death here a pebble under the wheel.”\nThe Mare’s skeletal hand gestures toward you, the chalice growing heavier in your grip. The shadows cast by the candlelight writhe and stir as their voice deepens slightly, carrying the same weight.\n“Hold your soul as an eternal concern, Edna dear. The cycle cleanses, but it is you who shape the path. Drink deep, my dear, and sleep. My Groom will see you right.”\nAs you lift the chalice, the liquid within shimmers like moonlight on water. You drink, and as the taste lingers—both sweet and bitter—the world tilts.\nThe darkness embraces you, not as an enemy, but as a mother comforting her child. You drift into sleep, the sound of hooves retreating echoing faintly in the distance.\nYou dream of an orchard under a burnt orange sky. The sound of crackling flame in all directions\nXOL: “EDNA…IS THAT YOU, ARE YOU … ALRIGHT?”\n"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/The-Party/Idril-Morfir/Idril-Morfir":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/The-Party/Idril-Morfir/Idril-Morfir","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/Elderwood World Building/Characters and Creatures/The Party/Idril Morfir/Idril Morfir.md","title":"Idril Morfir","links":["Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/High-Elves","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Wyld-Elves","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Groups-and-Organisations/The-Elven-Sovereignty","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Groups-and-Organisations/The-Sovereignty-Security-Bureau","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/Adversary-Archives/Elven-Supremacy/Lady-Elana-Eriyador","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/Adversary-Archives/Elven-Supremacy/Malrissa-Eriyador","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/Adversary-Archives/Necromancer-Cult/Vanta-Shikari","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/Adversary-Archives/Necromancer-Cult/Calvus-Sarconis","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/The-Party/The-Party","Drake-Hound"],"tags":["Party","Elven"],"content":"High Elves\nWyld Elves\nThe Elven Sovereignty\nThe Sovereignty Security Bureau\nLady Elana Eriyador\nMalrissa Eriyador\nVanta Shikari\nCalvus Sarconis\nThe Party\nJam the Drake Hound\n"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/The-Party/Magnus-Golddiggrumm/Fire-Forge-Dwarven-Ancestor":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/The-Party/Magnus-Golddiggrumm/Fire-Forge-Dwarven-Ancestor","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/Elderwood World Building/Characters and Creatures/The Party/Magnus Golddiggrumm/Fire Forge Dwarven Ancestor.md","title":"Fire Forge Dwarven Ancestor","links":["the-Deep-Canals","Emberlights","Vhertog","Surtr","Hrounvalla","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Kher-Muldur","Dwarven","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Dwarves"],"tags":[],"content":"Hrounvalla Aldroth\nLiteral translation She-Smith Fire-Blood\nExplored the Deep Canals, Prospected deep within the Emberlights untill they slipped and fell into the elemental plane of fire.\nThere they roved searching for a way home.

Think any medical drama where a character visualises medical knowledge in real time.\n-He has been to the same university as both (Attended The Crystal College: School of Thaumic Artifice). Would have known Edna as a Tea-lady/member of staff, well connected. Would have interected with Cornelius Moonwing for acquisition of magical artifacts or rare components, therefore gained acquaintance with Akki.\nWizards of the college that you knew had interactions with Moonwing spoke often but circumspectly about the possibilities that a Lepidoptra presents and uses for their potent Elemental energies.\n-Being the eternal ‘PhD’/‘PostDoc for a very very long time.\nStudied magical artifcats, did a post-doc on soul coins/ semi-sentient\n^^Lets broaden this a little and incorporate your dwarf’s skills, how about they studied thaumic energies and their containment. Including the power contained in soul coins and arcane or divine artifacts, different methods for containment and extraction.\n-First job that hires him and offers him some good money and opportunities was the fabricant creation programme. Did research for them, studying how it went, trying to replicate the process without all the costly electrum, but replicating electrum on the cheap was incredibly difficult. This seemed a bit dodgy, but was intimidated into continuing by scary bad guys.\n^^^ On the back of the above how about their research caught the eye of one Magister Calvus who directed them to the neo-fabricant research programme.\nSuspicious were raised when you were made to wear a blindfold on the journey to the facility and were not allowed to leave/see outside.\nThe Brass elves there looked sick and were cagey about the neo-fabricant creation process but they did let enough slip for you to know electrum is necessary and it’s usual source. Also that tremendous energies were required for something called The Immix Flux.\nCalvus encouraged the pursuit of pseudo-electrum and provided a number of soul coins, arcane gems etc for your attempts to infuse inert alloys. This would obviously make one of good morals a bit uncomfortable and  with but it didnt work and they became increasingly angry and begun suggesting necromancy as a potential solution. They also used your weave knowledge to develop the Aetheric Leechstones, used to draw in and store magic.\n-‘Worships’/Acknowledges many of the dwarven pantheon. The good ones (or at least neutral).\nEspecially God of Knowledge. This god has always been a source of divine inspiration, his ‘muse’.\nClings to a more local mining/metals god as a trace to home.\n^^Love the household god flavour thats brilliant.\nPraementum is the Numina god of Inspiration, Craft and Sorcery. They are the one who stopped the Brass Elves from being destroyed by the rest of the gods.\nIt is through Praementum that the veil is parted and the weave of magic is allowed access to the world.\nAs well as this the dwarves revere the ground itself, believing the earth, seas, skies etc to be sleeping godlike titan elementals. They also worship their ancestors and make great deal of the past’s accomplishments. It is important to dwarves that success never be forgotten and as such lorekeepers are held in high regard. We can workshop a particular potential ancestor if you like\nGods started to back off upon his recruitment,, but continued because money/equipment/opportunities  were good.  &lt; and coercion\n^^ It would makes sense that as you walked down a darker path that spark of inspiration from the gods began to get fainter.\n-Tries to leave the programme, has many many regrets. They force him to stay, becomes an unwilling participants.\nAfter having built X - very obvious bad evil thing, gods stopped whispering to him and has lost his connection to them.\n^^ A by product of the leechstone, pseudo-electrum and soul coin research and unwilling participation in a very dark necromantic ritual lead to the creation of soul cages. Usually the creation of soul coins must be via a demon or devil but this discovery then taken by Calvus and another mysterious benefactor has allowed them to trap and store the souls of mortals for their own nefarious purposes.\n-Somehow escapes - Party help?\n^^ This will depend on when we slot your new guy in but quite possibly, otherwise you eventually escaped on your own but have been on the run. Perhaps hearing Calvus being furious about the party lead you to seek them out.\n-Is now driven to undo the evil he has helped manufacture. Very good guy.

Their great rebellion during the Chinobiarch’s Folly allowed them to usurp their cruel masters but at great cost. The most powerful of the remaining elven clans vowed never again to be mastered by anyone and proceeded to conquer the other clans in what is now called The Unification of Elderwood.\nThis kingdom was achieved due to their aptitude for drake riding and sorcery, this substantial advantage is what gave them the power to conquer and integrate the other tribes to form the organisation seen today.\nIn recent times the sovereignty has been tested by a myriad of threats. The largest of which being The Ruin ofThe Northern Wastes which wiped out a large portion of their power base shifting rulership to the current monarch Padesha Empress Her Supreme Majesty Valsaketh Domina of All Elderwood\nCuriously the sovereignty’s fabled wyvern riders have been absent since the ruin and many of the subjugated cultures under the sovereignty are quietly questioning if the sovereignty is truly all powerful anymore.  \nThe sovereignty believes in security and stability above all things and is not above minor acts of tyranny to maintain it as stated by Grand Prefect Tsarnok: “When diplomacy fails we are left with only one alternative, violence, the beauty of shock and awe. Force must be applied without apology. It’s the Sovereignty way and it has kept our great isle in order for generations, we have moved to a new age of peace and prosperity far beyond our savage past and we will do whatever we must to maintain it”\nTsarnok later established the Sovereignty’s first Inquisitors which would eventually become The Sovereignty Security Bureau.\nHowever this has also lead to a great stagnation culturally for the sovereignty’s elite who are happy for the status quo to remain the same for eternity.

They were Titanspawn when the world was created the gods made a deal with the Titans in exchange for great arcane powers the Titans would be the shapers of the world, carving out islands, continents, mountains, and valleys at the Numina’s direction.\nHowever, the Numina were cunning the great powers they gave the Titans proved too much to for their minds to handle all at once and they fell into a deep sleep never to wake until their minds could recover and they would rise once more as gods.\nEons later the primeval elves discovered a sleeping Titan now more similar to a mountain range than a being. Within they found veins of a potent substance that enhanced their arcane powers exponentially. In their greed for this power, they devised a way to kill the Titan and claim it’s powerful ore. In attempting this act of divine murder the first dwarves appeared. Born from the rock of the Titan itself these dwarves, scholars believe, were formed unconsciously by the titan as a means of defense. However, the primeval elves succeeded and slew the titan in its eternal sleep greedily they took what scraps of power remained for their own purposes.\nAlthough the murder it seems was not absolute as dwarves continued to appear until there were enough to support a burgeoning civilization. Then once more the Titan lie dormant and has been until the present day leading some to consider it finally dead and a vast majority having forgotten its existence entirely.\nKepheros took this new species under his wing, teaching them the value of the rock and earth that had spawned them. They soon excelled in not only acquiring but refining and crafting with the bounty of the mountains, their heritage.\nThis drew the eye of Lucrumis-Aurur who offered Kepheros a deal in exchange for them.\nThe price paid was to craft for Kepheros an exquisite runed spearhead forged from the star metal Aethrium that Kepheros would use to fight back Taefana stopping her from afflicting his grove and creating evergreen trees that never decay as they were beyond the withering touch of Taefana. Lucrumis-Aurur saw Kepheros busy with the forest and encouraged the dwarves to exploit the earth further and uncover the riches he had hidden within, culminating in the dwarven culture present today.\nBut their origins can still be seen in their reverence for the stone they call home and their preference for the mountain caverns that bore them into this world.\nExtras"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Histories/The-Exodus":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Histories/The-Exodus","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/Elderwood World Building/Histories/The Exodus.md","title":"The Exodus","links":["Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Groups-and-Organisations/The-Elven-Sovereignty","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Goliath","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Taurus","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Orc","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Northern-Wastes/The-Northern-Wastes","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Atlas-of-Elderwood/The-Northern-Wastes/Ice-Ringed-Chaos","The-Wyvern-Aerie","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Characters-and-Creatures/Adversary-Archives/Elven-Supremacy/Vice-Marshal-Turel","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Groups-and-Organisations/The-Crystal-College"],"tags":["History"],"content":"The immense mission to rescue entrapped survivors of the ruin that became of the north.

They were Titanspawn when the world was created the gods made a deal with the Titans in exchange for great arcane powers the Titans would be the shapers of the world, carving out islands, continents, mountains, and valleys at the Numina’s direction.\nHowever, the Numina were cunning the great powers they gave the Titans proved too much to for their minds to handle all at once and they fell into a deep sleep never to wake until their minds could recover and they would rise once more as gods.\nEons later the primeval elves discovered a sleeping Titan now more similar to a mountain range than a being. Within they found veins of a potent substance that enhanced their arcane powers exponentially. In their greed for this power, they devised a way to kill the Titan and claim it’s powerful ore. In attempting this act of divine murder the first dwarves appeared. Born from the rock of the Titan itself these dwarves, scholars believe, were formed unconsciously by the titan as a means of defense. However, the primeval elves succeeded and slew the titan in its eternal sleep greedily they took what scraps of power remained for their own purposes.\nAlthough the murder it seems was not absolute as dwarves continued to appear until there were enough to support a burgeoning civilization. Then once more the Titan lie dormant and has been until the present day leading some to consider it finally dead and a vast majority having forgotten its existence entirely.\nKepheros took this new species under his wing, teaching them the value of the rock and earth that had spawned them. They soon excelled in not only acquiring but refining and crafting with the bounty of the mountains, their heritage.\nThis drew the eye of Lucrumis-Aurur who offered Kepheros a deal in exchange for them.\nThe price paid was to craft for Kepheros an exquisite runed spearhead forged from the star metal Aethrium that Kepheros would use to fight back Taefana stopping her from afflicting his grove and creating evergreen trees that never decay as they were beyond the withering touch of Taefana. Lucrumis-Aurur saw Kepheros busy with the forest and encouraged the dwarves to exploit the earth further and uncover the riches he had hidden within, culminating in the dwarven culture present today.\nBut their origins can still be seen in their reverence for the stone they call home and their preference for the mountain caverns that bore them into this world.\nExtras\nTrinominal\nTitus Demaris\nHome: Kher Muldur"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Eladrin":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Eladrin","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/Elderwood World Building/Races of Elderwood/Eladrin.md","title":"Eladrin","links":["Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/High-Elves","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Wyld-Elves"],"tags":["Species"],"content":"Genetic Descendants\nHigh Elves\nWyld Elves"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Fabricants":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Fabricants","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/Elderwood World Building/Races of Elderwood/Fabricants.md","title":"Fabricants","links":["Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Brass-Elves","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Groups-and-Organisations/The-Elven-Sovereignty"],"tags":["Species"],"content":"Golems have existed in Elderwood since the first animancers imbued false life into mundane objects of clay, wax or wood. Since the re-emergence of the Brass Elves these mindless machines have advanced by leaps and bounds culminating in The Gilded Legion which is still one of the mightiest military forces on the isles (though their unique origin and technomancy/construction is unknown). Now the push for innovation especially with the masterly work of the Brass Elves arcane craftsmen has created sophisticated  automata that are capable of advanced independent thought, constructed imitation of life. The Elven Sovereignty has outlawed any further advancement into Fabricant Beings (the term given to the theoretical automata with its own consciousness and soul) but even now in secret, some animacers experiment with the process of infusing the inanimate with souls.\nAnatomy\nThe core of a fabricant is a skeletal frame made of metal with special tensile alloy filaments acting as a muscular system. The core is covered in metal plates to protect the internals including a network of tubes that run through the fabricant’s body, these tubes are filled with a white blood-like fluid that is designed to lubricate and nourish their systems. Their appendages like most of their anatomy is dependent on their original construction but it is not unknown for a fabricant to have specialized modular appendages to make it more suited for its purpose.   The fabricants face loosely resembles their Brass Elf creators though they have a toothless jaw, heavy brow line and are lacking noses and hair. Each fabricant has a makers mark engraved upon them. Each of these runes is unique to the fabricants giving them a sense of individuality. Fabricants are able to be repaired and modified by artificers or even themselves giving them an endless possibility to their appearances.\nGenetics and Reproduction\nWhile an individual fabricant may possess a any personality, their form is dependent on their construction.\nDietary Needs and Habits\nFabricants do not need to eat or breathe but can ingest food and drink if you wish.

They are nomads, travellers and guardians of the Elemental plane of air, but as is custom adolescents make a pilgrimadge tour of the material plane or fae wilds with a fierce curiosity for all cultures and races    \nDapper, Dedicated and Smart\nStandard lepidoptra look like moths or butterflies, with large wings anchored to their back and long feathered antennae. Similar to moths they have a coat of soft downy fur or hair and a thick mane of fur around their neck and head. They have insect like appendages and sometimes compound eyes. What type of moth or buttlerfly they take after is highly variable, some appearing like common styes and others like large Atlas moths or Queen Alexandra Birdwings. They have a tendency to wear elaborate silk or finely woven garments, with different family and social groups placing more importance on the sheerness or texture of the woven garments. Richer and more influential lepidoptra will often wear brightly coloured garments decorated with beads and sequins. It is for this reason that shiny but simple jewellery that makes sound as it moves is favoured by the lepidoptra, who often choose to match their outfits to the appearance of their wings    \nCircadian Species\nThe work to maintain and protect the Elemental plane is a constant process. As such different clans work throughout the day and night. As such they have adapted to their environment. The more moth-like lepidoptra are almost entirely a nocturnal. They have limited daytime vision, though this can be corrected with glasses or lenses. However, they have fantastic dark vision, using smell to “see”. They prize perfume and enjoy making it themselves. During the night they will usually be constantly on the wing, tirelessly flying as they travel from place to place. This movement makes them excellent merchants, couriers and mercenaries as their swift movement means things get done faster. However they can be easily distracted, especially by bright lights which confuses their navigation.    \nSocial Structure\nLepidoptra often live among family groups but are know to work solitarily when required to maintain the Great Balance of the Planes. When they tour the other planes they will attempt to form bonds with others they meet, preffering to make a family away from family. When accepted they have known to assist in great works akin to their floating cities back home. These floating cities are filled with light, colour, music and delicate scents, making them a sight to behold. When they come of age some Lepidoptra choose to wander the other planes alone seeking something of great value to return with and to explore and expand their horizons. These Lepidoptra tend to wear the clothes of the other ground locked species and sometimes wear their shoes to save their feet as they walk.  \nMannerisms and names\nThe otherworldly race tends to exhibit bug like mannerisms, with strange and jerky movements. Though they will talk and chitter to one another they will also speak via movement and in some cases pheromones. Thus, outsiders often find it difficult to learn Lepidopti despite it’s similarities to Primordial. Lepidoptra will learn outside languages, favouring languages adapted to tusks or fangs like Orcish so that they can accommodate their mandibles."},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Orc":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Races-of-Elderwood/Orc","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/Elderwood World Building/Races of Elderwood/Orc.md","title":"Orc","links":["Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Groups-and-Organisations/The-Elven-Sovereignty"],"tags":["Species"],"content":"Title: Orc\nThe green skinned tusked orc are very familiar with hardship, living in nomadic steppe clans on the plains of the northern most tip of the mainland.

Represented as a spectral, skeletal horse draped in a white shroud and garland, The Grey Mare’s mythos intertwines the solemnity of death with the hope of renewal.\n\nDomains and Symbolism\n\nDeath and Rebirth: The Grey Mare embodies the paradox of death as both an end and a beginning, guiding souls through the transition to new cycles of existence.\nPsychopomp: She escorts the souls of the dead, presenting them to the gods for judgment and ensuring their proper placement in the afterlife.\nCycle Keeper: A fierce protector of the natural order, she opposes anything that disrupts the cycle, such as necromancy or unnatural immortality.\nSeasonal Association: Linked to the end of winter and the coming of spring, symbolising renewal after hardship.\n\n\nMythological Role\n\nArbiter of Souls: Upon death, The Grey Mare collects souls and presents them to the gods, who must argue their claims over them. She serves as the final judge, determining the soul’s destination based on deals, devotion, and tenets. The chosen god’s realm prepares the soul for eventual rebirth.\nOpposition to Necromancy: The Grey Mare strongly opposes necromancy as it disrupts the natural cycle. She reclaims souls bound by necromancers, curses those who defy her, and sends visions warning of necromancy’s dangers. However, she might tolerate respectful ancestral veneration or reluctant use of necromancy to restore balance.\nFestival of Transition: A festival in her honor involves offerings, feasting, and a dusk-till-dawn party, symbolising both placating The Grey Mare (forestalling death) and securing good fortune for the next cycle.\n\n\nAs a Patron\nIt is rare for The Grey Mare to have agents (Grooms of The Grey Mare) in the world but the powers granted to them likely align with her ethos.\n\n\nAbilities:\n\nSpectral Manifestations: Summoning ghostly entities or taking on a spectral form.\nSoul Shepherd: Guiding or banishing spirits and calming restless undead.\nCycle Resonance: Borrowing from future or past selves, restoring life, or accelerating decay.\nJudgment Powers: Banishing undead, imposing spiritual curses, or granting reprieves from death.\n\n\n\nBoons: Items like a spectral shroud or the ability to walk unseen in the spirit realm.\n\n\nDuties:\n\nGuiding lost souls to their afterlives.\nEnforcing the natural cycle by confronting necromancy or unnatural immortality.\nActing as a mediator or harbinger during times of death or rebirth.\nLeading or protecting festivals and sacred sites tied to the cycle.\n\n\n\n\nDuties of Her Grooms\nGrooms of The Grey Mare are tasked with preserving balance, enforcing her judgment, and aiding in the transition of souls. Examples include:\n\nResolving disputes over contested souls.\nRestoring balance to disrupted ecosystems or spiritual realms.\nHunting necromancers and other cycle-breakers.\nActing as agents of renewal and spiritual guides.\n\n\nThemes and Aesthetic\n\nSpectral Elegance: The Grey Mare’s form mirrors the Mari Lwyd: skeletal, shrouded, and hauntingly beautiful, embodying mystery and inevitability.\nDual Nature: She represents the fear of death and the hope of rebirth, with her actions inspiring reverence and awe.\nBalance and Transition: Her mythos emphasizes the importance of moving forward, whether through death, renewal, or spiritual growth.\n"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/The-Powers-That-Be/The-Numina/Days-of-Significance/Ivory-Communion":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/The-Powers-That-Be/The-Numina/Days-of-Significance/Ivory-Communion","filePath":"Elderwood

Participants clasp silver chains or braided cords, forming circles, while swearing personal oaths aloud. These range from public declarations of innocence to vows to right specific wrongs. Breaking an oath sworn on this day is considered both a crime and a spiritual curse.\n\n\nThe Tribunal Masque:\nIn major cities, a grand theatrical trial is staged—half morality play, half legal spectacle. Historical injustices, famous betrayals, or allegorical crimes are re-enacted with masked performers. A real audience jury deliberates the verdict, reminding all that justice is a living, communal responsibility.\n\n\nVigil of the Unburdened:\nFrom sunset to midnight, confession booths, temple alcoves, and even traveling priests offer private absolution for those who carry unspoken guilt or burdens. Though Ligatha despises deceit, she allows this one day for souls to unburden themselves anonymously—on the condition they make restitution within the year.\n\n\n\nUnique Divine Demands and Miraculous Events\n\n\nThe Judgment of Shadows:\nIt is whispered (flatly, by those with experience) that Ligatha occasionally manifests through animate shadows during the festivities. These shadows approach the truly guilty—those who have evaded mortal justice. They whisper accusations, reveal hidden evidence, or, in dire cases, physically restrain the wicked until proper authorities arrive.\n\n\nTrial by Light:\nSelect temples host literal trials for unresolved crimes or disputed grievances. A relic known as Ligatha’s Prism is used—those who pass through its refraction appear illuminated if truthful, darkened if deceitful. It’s deeply unreliable for trivial matters but terrifyingly accurate when guilt stains the soul.\n\n\nThe Scales’ Silence:\nFor one hour at midday, it is customary for cities to fall silent—markets close, voices hush—as all reflect on injustices unpunished. During this silence, it’s said Ligatha listens most keenly. Some claim petitions made during this hour have been granted as dreams, visions, or cryptic verdicts scrawled in ash or wax.\n\n\n\nAdditional Oddities\n\n\nPriests of Ligatha often carry portable ledgers or “Books of Redress”—citizens can record grievances, injustices, or disputes to be reviewed by the temple later. These books see heavy use on the holy day, with long queues and many passive-aggressive entries.\n\n\nIt is considered unlucky to lie, even jokingly, on The Righteous Sacrament. Superstition suggests Ligatha herself may brand false tongues with silver scars that fade only when the truth is spoken.\n\n\nExtras"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/The-Powers-That-Be/The-Numina/The-Autark-Mists/Kosmara":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/The-Powers-That-Be/The-Numina/The-Autark-Mists/Kosmara","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/Elderwood World Building/The Powers That Be/The Numina/The Autark Mists/Kosmara.md","title":"Kosmara","links":["Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/The-Powers-That-Be/The-Numina/Days-of-Significance/Sabbat-of-Waking","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/The-Powers-That-Be/The-Numina/The-Numina","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/The-Powers-That-Be/The-Numina/The-Autark-Mists/The-Autark-Mists","Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Planar-Gazetteer/Realms-of-The-Gods/The-Mirrorwash"],"tags":["Gods","Numina"],"content":"Overview\nThe Mother Oracle, The Dreamstrider and The Torpor Phantasm.

As such, it was the force that bound the world together. To get everything you desire in life, you had to have your ship navigate the river with entrepreneurial skill and grace. In practice, this meant that material taken from one area had to be replaced or paid for through another means, while avoiding obstacles and pitfalls. If one region had a shortage of one type of good, but a surfeit of another, while another region had too much of the former good and a shortage of the latter, then the Great River would carry the excess of the one region to ease the dearth in the other. Lucrumis-Aurur noted that the river could be very treacherous.\nThe River formed the moral center for trading society. By successfully navigating the River, a great businessman could ensure that people everywhere benefited from his own self-interest by each receiving what he or she wanted. The Grand Broker in particular was responsible for standing “at the bow of the economy’s ship of state”, navigating the waters of the Great River, avoiding the shoals of bankruptcy and seeking the strong winds of prosperity. Should a devout trader chart a profitable course through the great river upon their death their soul may buy their way into The Aurate Bazaar and exist in the luxury infinite wealth can buy forever.\nThe latter section of the book is a list of laws set down by Lucrumis-Aurur to guide his followers down The River.

A collation by the Wizards the crystal college.\nExtras\nContents\nIn the caverns of old, ugly and obscure, shines the gold of truth.\nEnveloped in infamy are the ancient kin of the high elves, enigmatic and ruthless the world still bears the scars of their cruelty, the long dead Eladrin.\nThere are few societies in Elderwood history that can boast the same potential as this race of elves.\nThey were wise, magically gifted and ambitious but their legacy was built on hubris.\nIf there’s one lesson to be learnt from studying the Eladrin it is that an empire built on stone and steel will succeed but an empire built on blood, bones and brutality will break.\nThe benevolent Numina teach their worshippers to be just and pure with each other a lesson the ancient Eladrin chose to ignore at their eventual peril for when their pride ceased to obscure their vision it was already too late.\nThe Eladrin famously said �Wear lore as your armour� but the wisdom of their lore was overcome by their lofty ambition and they resorted to cruelty and corruption to build their bloody Empire.\nThe Eladrin were once a prosperous race and remnants of their magnificent structures still defy the elements and the wear of time in Elderwood to this day.\nHistory does not look kindly on the ancient Eladrin, who rose to dominance on the Elderwood mainland forming an extensive empire from shore to shore.\nOne crucial difference between the eladrin and their elven kin is their respective Pantheon’s. The Eladrin were the first to worship the Numina we know today and did so indiscriminately.\nWhile other elven societies cut ties with The House of Tyrants (The Evil aligned Numina) the Eladrin cared little for the distinction between the good and the bad gods.\nThe ancestors of the elven population of Elderwood today saw this difference, however subjective that may be, and were fearful of the gods accepting their aid with a great deal of caution. They acknowledged how Ligatha�s attitude could teach them martial honour and how to deal retribution. They fed Kohannya�s vanity in exchange for her valuable domestic and artistic knowledge and they studied Vitrius� perfection to better order and govern themselves.\nCrucially what the High Elven ancestors also did was isolate the four most malevolent gods in their estimation and they warned their people not to meddle with them. These four dark gods became known as the House of Tyrants and consisted of Krauga Igrazi, Imparun S’gath, Mesarack and Loucura.\nHowever within the burgeoning Eladrin empire reverence for the numina was not initially quite so pervasive but when it took hold it was insidious quickly spreading like a silent plague. Unlike their High Elf kin the Eladrin did not allow morality to dictate the focus of their worship and quickly their veneration was focused on the entities who could best serve the interests of the empire.\nTo no surprise the more reprehensible members of the Numina were the ones to eagerly capitalize on this arrangement with even the most heinous gods subsequently the target of mass worship at the forefront being Krauga Igrazi the tyrannical god of domination and pain.\nThe gradual corruption of the Eladrin conscience across that ancient era lost to time reeks of Krauga�s fell influence.\nThe Eladrin began brokering deals with the gods, acquiring blessings and greater power and an unprecedented rate.\nAll of their dealings with the Numina helped them grow their empire but it was within Krauga�s divine domains that the Eladrin truly excelled.\nWith overwhelming force, an iron fist and the aid of demon armies the Eladrin preyed upon all they encountered. Vulnerable, outnumbered and needing societies were turned into vagrants as the Eladrin empire�s surged forward over the land raiding settlements killing the useless and making slaves of all those capable of working. Slavery, domination and cruelty were the order of the hour and no doubt Krauga was satisfied to see it.\nOn the backs of countless thralls, the Eladrin created a booming society. The subjugation of entire races brought prosperity the likes of which have never been seen since.\nCaptives/slaves were utilized for agriculture, building and the maintenance of their empire�s glorious infrastructure and architecture but most egregious of all slaves would be turned into sources of entertainment.\nTo worship a tyrannical god is a perilous endeavour without restraint and it is no wonder why revering a sadistic prince lead to the entire race becoming sadistic themselves.\nHowever it is to be expected that the few remaining records of eladrin were documented by their former victims and as such portray them as monstrous bellicose tyrants.\nWith their ill gotten powers and domination came great growth. Soon the eladrin had built a wondrous Empire on the shoulders of innumerable slaves and dark deals. It was only a matter of time before the burden proved too heavy to bear.\nAll of this sprouted from one mistake, allowing dark worship to go unregulated which lead to a tragic waste of this race’s potential.\nThe eladrin were an innovative people with a unique outlook on the universe. Magic was an enormous aspect of their society and were the first to treat magic as an academic skill to learn, a distant ancestor of modern wizardry.\nThe eladrin constructed the first idea of the world being formed of distinct elements. They believed the world was composed of four elements earth, water, air and light not fire but light.\nThis last element was the focal point for much of their culture and architecture they considered starlight to be the sublime element that linked the mortal realm to the realm of the gods.\nThis explains their Wells of magic, forged from meteoric iron to harness the energy of the stars. Even now thousands of years after they were abandoned mages can still replenish their power at these wells. They cut meteoric glass into large enchanted gems which could store magical auras. Unfortunately the eladrin fell long before they could truly tap the potential of these magics but even in the early stages of development this astral magic through meteoric vessels could store and transmit memories. It is rumoured that overuse of these crystals could even cause a capacity problem for mortals.\nHad the eladrin not brought about their own demise they could have achieved so much but instead these ancient sorceries remain tragically untouched.\nWhen the eladrin were consumed by avarice and turned to the Numina for help it was unfortunate had they been patient and honest in their advancements they surely would have reached the same heights eventually but instead with brutality their empire flourished at an alarming pace, a pace not possible through honest means.\nThe slavery itself was not the crux of their cruelty. The government of various elderwood regions permit slavery but the eladrin haven gained great infamy for the practice. History often isn’t fair and the victors write the history. This is true but in this case their reputation is well deserved.\nThe main reason the eladrin are perceived to be the worst the most arrogant and the most sadistic race in elderwood history is because of their merciless choice of entertainment, the sadistic art tortures created by the eladrin.\nTheir slaves were so undeserving of basic mortal rights that butchering them did not evoke any remorse or empathy in the masses of elves. Some men would become tortuous art installations for the strange pleasures of their masters such as the wailing wheels of Vindasal, the gut gardens of Cersin and flesh sculpture which was everywhere among the slaves of the eladrin in those dark days.\nWorse still was the realms of the fire King H�ghoull where through the forced ingestion of toxins drawn from demons slaves would inhale new visions of torment so vivid as to break the mind and children were set aflame for night-time tiger sport.\nThe eladrin were not content to simply use slaves for practical ends their brutality knew no limits.\nSlaves would build the eladrin’s cultural hubs be it courtyards, galleries or arenas and the slaves would also serve as the spectacles put through unthinkable Horrors for the amusement of the eladrin.\nThis demonstrates just how far their debauchery had festered. Cruelty for the good of advancement can be justified if you’re willing to suppress your moral compass but cruelty for pleasure is where the cultural rot set in. The eladrin let their hubris overcome their compassion and it foretold their downfall\n�Heedless the wicked man turns away and forsaking the simple wisdoms granted to him by the all-wise and the all knowing gods he lives in sin and ignorance all the days of his life he bears the awful burdens of his crimes and before men and gods his wickedness is known and neither blessing nor comfort may he expect from the altars and shrines of the gods.�\nFor a race so fond of remembering ones lore it is ironic that the eladrin couldn’t scry their destruction in the commands of their dark gods.\nThe harder the eladrin pulled on the chains of their servants the more severe the reckoning would be when the links finally snapped and when it came it came.\nBacked by some of the radical eladrin lords who grown disillusioned by the cultural hedonism a slave rebellion toppled the eladrin kingdoms.\nThe benevolent gods had been patient with the eladrin giving them ample opportunity to reform but when their tyranny remained malignant they were forced to intervene.\nThe high elven rebels were sent to punish the eladrin for their crimes. The Tyrant gods had offered the eladrin immediate advantages, fulfilling their superficial desires, helping them build an empire on a foundation of sand, it was destined to crumble.\nFrom here the eladrin began to fade into obscurity some minor eladrin lords remained in power as vassals to a burgeoning Kingdom which would eventually become the elven sovereignty, not all of the eladrin were complicit to the horrors that define their culture.\nRegardless there has not been a sighting of a living eladrin in over a 4 thousand years and many scholars would simply say that the eladrin have gone extinct.\nHowever it is well-documented that an elite diaspora occurred at the falling of the eladrin empire.\nMany of the eladrin sought refuge in other provinces some like the ones who attempted to sail to new land were likely wiped out by the sea serpents but others were successful.\nSome made it to the burgeoning elven sovereignty as a result it is speculated that the eladrin assimilated with the other elves and their nobility. If the eladrin successfully assimilated into the nobility of the elven sovereignty that could certainly explain a lot of the elitism, subjugation of mankind and great concern for ethnic purity.\nAnywhere there are elves discriminating humans it is entirely possible that remnants of the old corrupt eladrin Empire are a part of the machinations they could very well be extinct but there is always a chance that they are hidden in plain sight plotting their revenge on the race�s of elderwood and the gods who betrayed them.\nType\nManuscript, Historical"},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Worldbuilding-Checklist":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/Elderwood-World-Building/Worldbuilding-Checklist","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/Elderwood World Building/Worldbuilding Checklist.md","title":"Worldbuilding Checklist","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"A World Building Checklist\nWhen a game master is working on creating a world, there are a lot of details to work out.

Vault Wiki/NON-ELDERWOOD/Kessel Sabaac/Kessel Sabaac Rules.md","title":"Kessel Sabaac Rules","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Goal\nIn Kessel Sabacc, you invest chips to improve your hand and get a Sabacc hand, which is a pair of cards – one from each deck. To win a round, you need to have the best hand at the end of 3 turns.\nThe closer the card values are to zero, the stronger the sabacc hand is. Try to improve your hand by Drawing, or choose Standing if you’re happy with what you have.\nThe last player with chips in stock wins the game, and the credits in the pot.\nPieces\nCards\nNumber Cards\nHands are made of 2 cards, one from each family — Sand and Blood — with most cards being numbers 1 to 6. The card value is depicted by its header and central symbol.\nSpecialty Cards\nImpostor cards take the result value of a dice throw during the reveal phase.\nSylop cards match the value of the other card in hand during the reveal phase. Having a hand with a Sylop and any other card is called a Sylop Sabacc. A pair of Sylops is Pure Sabacc, the best hand of the game.\nThere are 3 cards for each value per family, and 2 Sylops for a total of 44 cards.\nChips\nEach player is given chips, usually 4-8, that will allow the player to draw cards. You lose the round when you run out of chips.\n\nShift Tokens\nShift Tokens are effect tokens that can only be played before Draw or Stand actions. There are 16 unique shift tokens:\n\nFree Draw – Avoid the draw fee this turn (draw a card without needing to pay one chip)\nRefund – Retrieve 2 chips in play (Return 2 tokens to your pile, you can only use it when you have previously paid at least 1 chip this round)\nExtra Refund – Retrieve 3 chips in play\nGeneral Tariff – Other players are taxed one chip (Other players are taxed one chip, as if buying a card)\nTarget Tariff – Target player is taxed 2 chips\nEmbargo – Next player must stand (It interferes with the next player’s plans for their turn)\nMarkdown – Set Sylop value to 0 until next reveal (Sylop would then only make a Sabacc Hand with another Sylop and not with any other number)\nImmunity – Prevent Shift Token effects against you until next reveal\nGeneral Audit – Other players in stand are taxed 2 chips. (Players this turn who have chosen to stand must invest 2 chips)\nTarget Audit – Choose a player in Stand. They are taxed three chips.\nMajor Fraud – Set Impostor value to 6 until next reveal\nEmbezzlement – Take one chip from each player’s pot to your pot\nCook the Books – Inverts Sabacc ranks until the next reveal (6/6 Sabacc is the best)\nExhaustion – Choose a player. They must discard and draw a new hand.\nDirect Transaction – Choose a player. Trade hands with them.\nPrime Sabacc – Roll two dice. Pick one value as the new best sabacc.\n\nSetup\nEach player will need to pay the buy-in cost to play. Generally, this is 50-200 credits. The price depends on the individual table. All players must pay the agreed upon amount to play. Players place credits in the pot.\nPlayers place their shift tokens on the table face down.\nThe dealer deals 2 cards to each player, one from each of the 2 decks. Then places the 2 decks in the middle and turns over 1 card from each deck to act as a discard pile.\n\nThe dealer gives each player 4-8 chips depending on the price of the buy-in (50 credits – 4 chips, 200 credits – 8 chips). Alternatively, players can agree to a chip count.\nGameplay\nGameplay consists of multiple Rounds consisting of 3 turns each. Gameplay ends when only one player has chips left. On their turn, players may play a Shift Token then Draw or Stand.\nPlay a Shift Token\nPlayers can choose a Shift Token and play it.\nDrawing a Card \nPlayers can choose to draw from either facedown deck, or either faceup discard pile.\nWhen players draw, they must discard either the card they draw, or the card in their hand from the matching deck. Players must always end their turn with one card from each deck. Drawing costs 1 chip.\nTurns\nEach Round of play consists of 3 turns before you reveal your hand,\nEach turn you may choose to play a Shift Token (if you have any left) then Draw or Stand.\nReveal Cards\nPlayers will reveal their hands clockwise, starting with the dealer, until everyone has revealed.\nIf your hand includes one or more Impostor cards, you will need to roll the Sabacc Dice.\nDice Selection\nRoll the Sabacc Dice. Choose one of the obtained values to replace the Impostor card and complete your hand.\nYou will need to do this for each Impostor card in your hand.\nThe round winner takes their invested chips back to their stock (only the chips invested this round).\nTie\nIt is possible that any hand can result in a tie; for example, 2 players each having a hand of 1,1. In this case, both players will get their chips back, for the rest of the players, chip penalties still apply.\nChips Penalties \nWithout a Sabacc hand, you are taxed an amount equal to the difference of your card values. With a losing sabacc hand, you are taxed 1 chip. All taxed chips are lost."},"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/NON-ELDERWOOD/Kessel-Sabaac/Kessel-Sabaac":{"slug":"Elderwood-Vault-Wiki/NON-ELDERWOOD/Kessel-Sabaac/Kessel-Sabaac","filePath":"Elderwood Vault Wiki/NON-ELDERWOOD/Kessel Sabaac/Kessel Sabaac.md","title":"Kessel Sabaac","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"hyperspaceprops.com/product/kessel-sabacc-set-with-deck-dice-tokens-chips/\nKessel Sabacc Set with Deck, Dice, 16 chips, Starter Shift Tokens\nInspired from Star Wars Outlaws, now you play Kessel Sabacc in real life with your friends!
